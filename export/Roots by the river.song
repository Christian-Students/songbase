[C]I am a tree with roots
By the [F]river of living [C]water,
Trials still may [Am]come,
But they [F]end in victo[G]ry.
And [F]even in the [C]wilder[Am]ness,
When [Dm]there’s no hope at [G]all,
[Dm]I have roots by the [G]river of the[C] Lord.

When the [F]scorching sun a[C]rrives,
My [E]leaves won’t wither and[Am] die,
[F]I have roots by the [G]river of the [C]Lord.

#Deuteronomy 8:3

And He humbled me and let me go hungry
And He fed me the manna,
Which I had never known nor
My fathers had ever known, so
That He might make me know
That man lives not by bread alone,
Man lives not by bread alone,
But that man
Lives by everything that
Proceeds out from the mouth
Of Jehovah.

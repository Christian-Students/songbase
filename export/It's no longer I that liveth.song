[D]It’s no longer I that [G]liveth,
But [D]Christ that [Bm]liveth in[Em A7] me.
It’s [D]no longer I that [G]liveth,
But [D]Christ that [A7]liveth in[D] me.
He l[G]ives, He[D] lives,
Jesus is [Bm]alive in[Em A7] me!
It’s [D]no longer I that l[G Em]iveth,
But C[D]hrist that [A7]liveth in[D] me.

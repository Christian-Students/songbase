[C]Above the waste and [F]emptiness
B[C]roods the Spirit of [G]God,
[C]Bringing forth God’s s[F]peaking in us.
[C]Hey! [G]Let there be [C]light!

{start_of_chorus} 
And the light shines [F]in the darkness,
[C]And the darkness did [G]not overcome.
[C]In Him was [F]life, and the life was the [C  G  ]light [C]of men.
{end_of_chorus}

Nights decreasing, day increasing,
Every day His Word we’re seeking;
Don’t be discouraged, spirit releasing!
We are the children of light.

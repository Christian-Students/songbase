[C]We have a [F]Father
Whose [C]heart is full of [G]love toward us.
[C]His heart is so g[F]reat
And His [C]love is so un[G]limited.
[F]Even when we [G]sin,
We can [Em]always come back to [Am]Him;
T[F]his is our Father’s great [G]love toward[C] us.
[F]We just need to re[G]pent,
In His [Em]loving arms we were [Am]meant;
[Dm]This is our Father’s great [G]love toward [C]us.

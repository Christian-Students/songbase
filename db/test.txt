Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit-
Ever One.

2
As we view the vast creation,
Planned with wondrous skill,
So our hearts would move to worship,
And be still.

3
But, our God, how great Thy yearning
To have sons who love
In the Son e'en now to praise Thee,
Love to prove!

4
'Twas Thy thought in revelation,
To present to men
Secrets of Thine own affections,
Theirs to win.

5
So in Christ, through His redemption
(Vanquished evil powers!)
Thou hast brought, in new creation,
Worshippers!

6
Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit
Ever One.

1
Glory, glory, glory, praise and adoration!
Hear the anthems swelling out thro' all eternity!
Father, Son, and Spirit-God in revelation-
Prostrate each soul before the Deity!

2
Father, source of glory, naming every fam'ly;
And the Son upholding all by His almighty power;
Holy Spirit, filling the vast scene of glory-
O glorious Fullness, let our hearts adore!

3
God supreme, we worship now in holy
Splendor, Head of the vast scene of bliss, before Thy face we fall!
Majesty and greatness, glory, praise and power
To Thee belong, eternal Source of all!

Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing,
Help us to praise.
Father, all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.

2
Come, Thou incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy mighty sword,
Our prayer attend:
Come, and Thy people bless,
And give Thy word success;
Spirit of holiness,
On us descend.

3
Come, holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear
In this glad hour:
Thou who Almighty art,
Now rule in every heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of power.

4
To Thee, great One in Three,
Eternal praises be
Hence evermore.
Thy sov'reign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore.

Father of heav'n, whose love profound
A ransom for our souls hath found,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy pardoning love extend.

2
Almighty Son, incarnate Word,
Our Prophet, Priest, Redeemer, Lord,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy saving grace extend.

3
Eternal Spirit, by whose breath
The soul is raised from sin and death,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy quickening power extend.

4
Thrice holy-Father, Spirit, Son;
Mysterious Godhead, Three in One,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
Grace, pardon, life to us extend.

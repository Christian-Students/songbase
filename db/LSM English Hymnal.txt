Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit
Ever One.

As we view the vast creation,
Planned with wondrous skill,
So our hearts would move to worship,
And be still.

But, our God, how great Thy yearning
To have sons who love
In the Son e'en now to praise Thee,
Love to prove!

'Twas Thy thought in revelation,
To present to men
Secrets of Thine own affections,
Theirs to win.

So in Christ, through His redemption
(Vanquished evil powers!)
Thou hast brought, in new creation,
Worshippers!

Glory be to God the Father,
And to Christ the Son,
Glory to the Holy Spirit
Ever One.--------2
Glory, glory, glory, praise and adoration!
Hear the anthems swelling out thro' all eternity!
Father, Son, and Spirit  God in revelation
Prostrate each soul before the Deity!

Father, source of glory, naming every fam'ly;
And the Son upholding all by His almighty power;
Holy Spirit, filling the vast scene of glory
O glorious Fullness, let our hearts adore!

God supreme, we worship now in holy splendour,
Head of the vast scene of bliss, before Thy face we fall!
Majesty and greatness, glory, praise and power
To Thee belong, eternal Source of all!--------3
Come, Thou Almighty King,
Help us Thy name to sing,
Help us to praise.
Father, all glorious,
O'er all victorious,
Come, and reign over us,
Ancient of Days.

Come, Thou incarnate Word,
Gird on Thy mighty sword,
Our prayer attend:
Come, and Thy people bless,
And give Thy word success;
Spirit of holiness,
On us descend.

Come, holy Comforter,
Thy sacred witness bear
In this glad hour:
Thou who Almighty art,
Now rule in every heart,
And ne'er from us depart,
Spirit of power.

To Thee, great One in Three,
Eternal praises be
Hence evermore.
Thy sov'reign majesty
May we in glory see,
And to eternity
Love and adore.--------4
Father of heav'n, whose love profound
A ransom for our souls hath found,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy pard'ning love extend.

Almighty Son, incarnate Word,
Our Prophet, Priest, Redeemer, Lord,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy saving grace extend.

Eternal Spirit, by whose breath
The soul is raised from sin and death,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
To us Thy quickening power extend.

Thrice holy  Father, Spirit, Son;
Mysterious Godhead, Three in One,
Before Thy throne we sinners bend;
Grace, pardon, life to us extend.--------5

We, Thy children, bless Thy Name!

For the riches we inherit,
Heart and voice to Thee we raise!
We adore Thee! we adore Thee!
Thee we bless, through endless days!
We adore Thee! we adore Thee!
Thee we bless, through endless days!--------6
Holy, Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty!
Unto everlasting days our song shall rise to Thee;
Holy, Holy, Holy, Merciful and Mighty!
God in Three Persons, blessed Trinity!

Holy, Holy, Holy! All the saints adore Thee;
Heaven's elders cast their crowns down by the glassy sea;
Cherubim and seraphim worship too before Thee,
Who wert, and art, and evermore shalt be.

Holy, Holy, Holy! though the darkness hide Thee,
Though the eye of sinful man Thy glory may not see,
Only Thou art holy, there is none beside Thee
Perfect in power, in love, and purity.--------7
Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!
Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!

  As it was, is now, and shall be

O God, th' eternal Father, Thou,
The uncreated, great I AM!
More ancient than the ancients are,
Before the primal age began!

From everlasting Thou art God,
All time and space Thou dost transcend!
The fulness of eternity,
Without beginning, without end!

Th' eternal source of all Thou art,
Before the heavens were decreed!
Thou art the first of all the first,
And e'en the foremost dost precede!

Thou art the life that ever lasts,
From age to age Thou endest not!
More lasting than all that which lasts,
Beyond the ultimate Thou art!

Thou art the Alpha as the first,
Omega, as the last Thou art!
From start to end Thou hast no lack,
Complete and perfect, wanting not!

We praise Thee for Thine endless years,
Extol Thee for Thy boundlessness!
We praise Thee for Thy fulness vast,
Extol Thee for Thy perfectness--------11
Thou, Father, who art Spirit true,
The holiest of all;
We worship in the spirit now,
In truth upon Thee call.

A spirit Thou hast made for us
That we may worship Thee,
That echoing in spirit thus
One spirit we will be.

The Father in the Son has come,
The Son the Spirit is,
That to our spirit God may come.
O what a grace is this!

The Son is Thine eternal Word,
The Word is Spirit too;
The Spirit as our life has come
Our spirit to renew.

Thy Spirit in our spirit is,
And thus in unity
Thy Spirit witnesseth with ours
That we are born of Thee.

In everything Thy Spirit leads
That we may follow Him;
We thus may spiritual become,
With life and peace within.

In spirit we would worship Thee,
In spirit Thee address,
Until our spirit is released
Thine image to express.

Our Father, we would praise Thee now
That Thou the Spirit art;
In spirit and in truth to Thee
True worship we impart.--------12
O God, Thou art the source of life,
Divine, and rich and free!
As living water flowing out
Unto eternity!

In love Thou in the Son didst flow
Among the human race;
Thou dost as Spirit also flow
Within us thru Thy grace.

Though we in sin and wickedness
Went far from Thee apace,
Yet in the Son Thou didst redeem,
Bestowing life and grace.

Though we have often slighted Thee,
Thy Spirit often grieved,
Yet Thou dost still as Spirit come
As life to be received.

Thou as the Spirit in the Son
Hast mingled heretofore;
Thou wilt thru fellowship anoint
And increase more and more.

The love of God, the grace of Christ,
The Spirit's flowing free,
Enable us God's wealth to share
Thru all eternity.

The Father, Son, and Spirit  one,
So richly care for us;
Thy love with one accord we sing
And e'er would praise Thee thus.--------13
Thou art love and Thou art light, Lord,
In the Son as life Thou art;
Love expressing, light illum'ning,
Thou dost life to us impart.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

Love bespeaks Thy very being,
What Thou dost is shown by light;
Love is inward, light is outward,
Love accompanies the light.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

Love by grace is manifested,
And the light by truth is shown;
By Thy love we may enjoy Thee;
By Thy light Thou, Lord, art known.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

Thru Thy love, which led to Calvary,
We receive the life of God;
Light our understanding opens,
That we may apply the blood.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

Thru Thy love, as life Thou enter'st
Fellowship with Thee to give;
Thru Thy light we take Thy cleansing
And in fellowship may live.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

By the light and blood which cleanses,
The anointing we shall know;
Then the life of love Thine essence,
More and more in us will flow.

  Thou art love! Thou art light!
  In the Son as life Thou art;
  Love expressing, light illum'ning
  Thou dost life to us impart.

By Thy love we are Thy children,
Abba Father calling Thee;
Light disperses all our darkness,
Till, like Him, Thy Son, we see.

  O what grace! O what truth!
  Love is seen and light is shown!
  We would praise Thee never ceasing,
  Thou by love and light art known!--------14
Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.

Unresting, unhasting, and silent as light,
Nor wanting, nor wasting, Thou rulest in might;
Thy justice like mountains high soaring above,
Thy clouds which are fountains of goodness and love.

To all life Thou givest, to both great and small;
In all life Thou livest, the true life of all;
We blossom and flourish as leaves on the tree,
And wither and perish, but nought changeth Thee.

Great Father of Glory, pure Father of Light,
Thine angels adore Thee, all veiling their sight;
All laud we would render, O help us to see:
'Tis only the splendor of light hideth Thee.

Immortal, invisible, God only wise,
In light inaccessible hid from our eyes,
Most blessed, most glorious, the Ancient of Days,
Almighty, victorious, Thy great name we praise.--------15
O God, Thou art transcendent,
The Holy One Thou art!
None other is Thine equal,
Incomp'rable Thou art!
The holiest of the holy
The universe may call!
Thy power and Thy nature
Do far exceed it all!

Distinct, unique, and holy,
Not only right and pure;
Not only without defect,
But with perfection more;
For nothing can approach Thee,
Nor e'er Thine equal be;
If aught Thy place hath taken,
'Tis insult unto Thee.

The excellent excelling,
The fairest of the fair,
Yet differing from the finest,
For none with Thee compare.
From all the righteous different,
For Thine is absolute;
None beauteous with Thee vying,
For Thine excels repute.

Thy holiness transcendent
Thou hast for us prepared,
And this distinctive nature
We have already shared.
We share in Thy transcendence,
Since we Thy nature own;
Thy holy life we follow
Till unto fulness grown.

We give Thee praise and worship
For all Thy holiness,
For Thy transcendent nature,
Thine utter peerlessness.
We praise Thee that Thy nature
Unique, distinct  we share;
This separating nature
Is ours now and fore'er.--------16
Our Father, as the evergreen,
Thou art forever new;
Thou art the ever living Lord,
Thy freshness as the dew.

  O Father, Thou art unchanging,
  Thou never hast grown old;
    Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
    Thy newness doth unfold.

O Thou art God, and Thou art "new";
Without Thee all is worn,
But all with Thee is ever fresh,
Though many years have gone.

  O Father, Thou art unchanging,
  Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
Thy newness doth unfold.

Each blessing Thou hast given us
Thy newness doth contain;
Thy covenant, Thy ways are new,
And ever thus remain.

  O Father, Thou art unchanging,
  Thou never hast grown old;
  Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
  Thy newness doth unfold.

Now we Thy new creation are
New spirit and new heart;
We're daily from the old renewed,
New life Thou dost impart.

  O Father, Thou art unchanging,

  Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
  Thy newness doth unfold.

The earth and heavens will be new
And Thy new city share;
New fruits each month will be supplied,
For all is newness there.

  Thou never hast grown old;
  Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
  Thy newness doth unfold.

O Father, Thou art ever new,
And all is new in Thee;

New praise we give to Thee.

  O Father, Thou art unchanging,
  Thou never hast grown old;
  Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
  Thy newness doth unfold.--------17
My Father God, when on Thy vast creation.
The wonders of the heav'n and earth, I gaze.
Things great and small, beyond enumeration,
Which manifest Thy pow'r in untold ways;

  Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!
  And this I'll sing through all eternity,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!

As I enjoy the grace of Thy salvation
And contemplate how Thou Thy Son hast sent,
Who died that we might be Thy new creation,
Thy life expressing to the full extent;

  Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!
  And this I'll sing through all eternity,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!

When in the church, in blest participation,
I see how millions Thine own life possess,
How they are built to form Thy habitation,
Containing Thee, Thy fulness to express;

  Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!
  And this I'll sing through all eternity,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!

As I expect the coming age of fulness
And hope to share the new Jerusalem,
With all the heavens and the earth in newness
And all Thou art expressed in all of them;

  Then all my being sings in praise to Thee,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!
  And this I'll sing through all eternity,
  How marvelous! How great Thou art!--------18
How faithful and trustworthy too,
My Father God, art Thou;
The universe and all therein
Thy faithfulness avow.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

No turning shadow could there be,
Nor any change with Thee;
As Thou hast been, and now Thou art,
Forever Thou wilt be.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

Thy word, as certain as Thyself,
Can never pass away;
Though heav'n and earth shall disappear,
Thy word abides for aye.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

Thy gifts without repentance are,
Thy calling is the same;
Thy grace forever lasting is,
Thy mercy as Thy name.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

Thy word with Thine own faithfulness
A surety is to me;
By it, with Thy salvation true,
I have the certainty.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

If, due to self, I trust Thee not,
Yet Thou art faithful still;
Thou never canst deny Thyself,
Thy word Thou shalt fulfill.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

As Thou art faithful to perform
Thy promise and Thy call;
So, feeding on Thy faithfulness,
I take Thyself withal.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.

The rainbow round about Thy throne
Thy faithfulness declares;
This attribute forevermore
The holy city bears.

  How steadfast is Thy faithfulness!
  For this I worship Thee;
  It is established in the heav'n,
  And ever stands for me.--------19
"Great is Thy faithfulness," O God my Father,
There is no shadow of turning with Thee;
Thou changest not, Thy compassions, they fail not;
As Thou hast been Thou forever wilt be.

  "Great is Thy faithfulness!" "Great is Thy faithfulness!"
  Morning by morning new mercies I see;
  All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
  "Great is Thy faithfulness," Lord, unto me!

Summer and winter, and springtime and harvest,
Sun, moon and stars in their courses above,
Join with all nature in manifold witness
To Thy great faithfulness, mercy and love.

  "Great is Thy faithfulness!" "Great is Thy faithfulness!"
  Morning by morning new mercies I see;
  All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
  "Great is Thy faithfulness," Lord, unto me!

Pardon for sin and a peace that endureth,
Thy own dear presence to cheer and to guide;
Strength for today and bright hope for tomorrow,
Blessings all mine, with ten thousand beside!

  "Great is Thy faithfulness!" "Great is Thy faithfulness!"
  Morning by morning new mercies I see;
  All I have needed Thy hand hath provided
  "Great is Thy faithfulness," Lord, unto me!--------20
God our Father, we adore Thee,
For the sake of righteousness;
Thou in Christ hast justified us,
Who our conscience can depress?
Thou art righteous, and art faithful,
On Thy righteousness we stand;
No unrighteousness is in Thee,
None can turn Thy righteous hand.

Thou hast laid our sins on Jesus,
By Thy justice He was killed;
All Thy holy law's requirements
For Thy justice He fulfilled.
Recompense from Him receiving,
Thou art fully satisfied;
How couldst Thou, O God most righteous,
Claim it once more from our side?

Father God, Thou hast accepted
Jesus as our Substitute;
Judged the Just One for the unjust,
Couldst Thou change Thy attitude?
As a proof of perfect justice,
At Thine own right hand He sits;
He, as Thy full satisfaction,
Righteously Thy need befits.

Father, through the blood of Jesus
We possess Thy righteousness;
By Thy righteousness protected,
None can shake our steadfastness.
Righteousness of Thine Thou mad'st us,
None can ever us condemn;
We'll forever testify this
In the new Jerusalem.--------21
We praise Thee for Thy righteousness;
Thy justice, Father, we confess,
And fully testify.
Thou art the judge of all mankind,
In Thee injustice none can find,
Nor wrong to Thee apply.

O holy Father, righteous One,
Thy righteousness upholds Thy throne,
'Tis a foundation sure.
'Tis through this righteousness of Thine
That reigns in Christ the grace divine,
And peace we thus secure.

Thy righteousness has caused Thy Son
To die for us that we be won,
Redemption thus was bought;
Thy righteousness has justified
When Christ's redemption was applied,
Salvation thus was wrought.

That Thou might show Thy righteousness,
With Thy forgiveness Thou didst bless
Men in the ancient age;
For Thee Thy righteousness to show,
Remission Thou dost now bestow
On sinners in this age.

All people Thou wilt judge one day,
Thy righteousness to all display
By Christ, Thy Son, our Lord;
Yet fast we'll stand, for none can move,
Thy righteousness we'll ever prove,
With grace Thou wilt afford.

With justice is Thy kingdom filled,
And peace upon it Thou dost build
With all in harmony;
In the new heaven and new earth
Thy righteousness will be their worth,
As promised, God, by Thee.--------22
Holy Father, we adore Thee,
Rev'rent song to Thee we raise;
Thou art holy, Thou art lofty,
"Holy is Thy Name," we praise.

Loving is Thy heart, dear Father,
Righteous ever are Thy ways;
But how holy is Thy nature,
Yet, to us Christ it conveys.

Thou hast ever sanctified us
With the blood of Christ our Lord;
Thou hast separated sinners
Thru the truth which is Thy Word.

Thou hast, by Thy Holy Spirit,
Made us holy unto Thee;
And our spirit, soul, and body
Wholly sanctified will be.

Oh! The holy life of Jesus
Thru Thy grace we now possess;
Thou wilt make us e'en partakers
Of Thy very holiness.

When within that holy city,
Thy full holiness we'll share,
To the uttermost forever,
"Thou art holy," we'll declare.--------23
In all Thy wisdom, Father God,
According to Thy will,
Eternal purpose Thou hast made
That all Thy Son might fill.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!

How wondrously Thou mad'st all things,
O who can know Thy mind?
All are of Thee, thru Thee, to Thee,
Thy wisdom here we find.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!

Thy wisdom shuts up all in sin,
That mercy may be shown,
That none may boast in anything
But in Thyself alone.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!

In wisdom, by the cross, Thou hast
For us redemption made,
That in our spirit we may have
Thyself, the treasure, laid.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!

Thy wisdom thru Thy Church is known
By principalities,
Thru us Thy wisdom manifold
Shown in the heavenlies.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!

When in the new Jerusalem
In mercy we will boast,
Thy wisdom will be known for aye
Unto the uttermost.

  How deep and rich Thy wisdom is,
  O who can search and trace?
  Yet, Father God, in it we find
  Thy mercy and Thy grace!--------24
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

O God, in Christ all focused is
Thy wisdom with Thy grace;
As wisdom Thou mad'st Him to us,
In Him Thy way we trace.

What Thou has planned is all in Him,
Thy way of grace is He;
In Him, Thy Wisdom, we have all,
That glory be to Thee.

In Him, who is our righteousness,
Have we been justified;
In Him, who is our holiness,
We're being sanctified.

Redemption too He is to us,
According to Thy plan,
That we may fully be redeemed
To be a perfect man.

He is Thy wisdom, Father God,
In Thine economy;
For Him we offer praise to Thee
With all humility.

Thy wisdom we have seen in Him,
So rich and so profound;
Yet richer, deeper, in Thy way,
By us will it be found.--------25
Father, to us Thy mercy Thou hast shown,
In Thine own way;
Sinners like us as dear sons Thou wouldst own,
In love for aye.
Vessels of mercy, Thou didst us prepare;
Vessels of honor, we Thyself declare.

"In mercy I delight, not sacrifice,"
Thou hast declared;
Thru this Thy mercy, favor in Thine eyes
We all have shared.
'Tis not of them that will nor them that run,
But of Thee showing mercy as was done.

Father, Thy mercy with Thy love and grace
Did we obtain;
And in Thy mercy, with Thee face to face,
We'll e'er remain;
And for Thy mercy we would worship Thee
Through all our days and through eternity.--------26
  Repeat the last line of each verse

God, we praise Thee for Thy mercy,
'Tis so great and so profound!
In our weakness and our failures;
With its greatness it abounds.
We adore Thee! We adore Thee!
With such mercy we've been crowned!

How we marvel at this mercy
So far-reaching and so vast!
It has reached us, e'en the sinners,
And will ever hold us fast.
From this mercy, from this mercy,
What can cause us to be cast?

For Thy mercy we are grateful,
'Tis so rich, so plenteous!
Thru Thy mercy in redemption,
Thou hast richly favored us.
If without this, if without this,
How could we be favored thus?

Oh, Thy mercy, so inspiring!
Gentle, tender, dear and sweet!
With Thy patience and Thy kindness,
Us in all our need it meets.
It we treasure, it we treasure,
Nothing can with it compete.

Father, we enjoy Thy mercy,
Ever fresh and ever new;
Every morning shed upon us,
It refreshes as the dew.
How we taste it! How we taste it!
Giving Thee the praises due.

We can never cease to praise Thee,
As Thy mercy e'er endures;
All Thy grace and all Thy favor,
Ever for us it secures.
Trusting in it, trusting in it,
Thy sure mercy us assures.--------27
Come, let us all unite to sing,
God is love, God is love.
Let heav'n and earth their praises bring;
God is love, God is love.
Let ev'ry soul from sin awake,
Each in his heart sweet music make,
And sing with us, for Jesus' sake,
God is love! God is love!

How happy is our portion here!
God is love, God is love.
His promises our spirits cheer;
God is love, God is love.
He is our sun and shield by day,
Our help, our hope, our strength, and stay,
He will be with us all the way:
God is love! God is love!

In glory we shall sing again,
God is love, God is love.
Yes, this shall be our lofty strain,
God is love, God is love.
While endless ages roll along,
In concert with the heav'nly throng,
This shall be still our sweetest song,
God is love! God is love!--------28
The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell.
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin.

  O love of God, how rich and pure!
  How measureless and strong!
  It shall forevermore endure
  The saints' and angels' song.

When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God's love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam's race
The saints' and angels' song.

  O love of God, how rich and pure!
  How measureless and strong!
  It shall forevermore endure
  The saints' and angels' song.

Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky.

  O love of God, how rich and pure!
  How measureless and strong!
  It shall forevermore endure
  The saints' and angels' song.--------29
What was it, blessed God,
Led Thee to give Thy Son,
To yield Thy Well-beloved
For us by sin undone?
'Twas love unbounded led Thee thus,
To give Thy Well-beloved for us.

What led Thy Son, O God,
To leave Thy throne on high,
To shed His precious blood,
To suffer and to die?
'Twas love  unbounded love to us
Led Him to die and suffer thus.

What moved Thee to impart
Thy Spirit from above,
Therewith to fill our heart
With heavenly peace and love?
'Twas love  unbounded love to us
Moved Thee to give Thy Spirit thus.

What love to Thee we owe,
Our God, for all Thy grace!
Our hearts may well o'erflow
In everlasting praise!
Make us, O God, to praise Thee thus
For all Thy boundless love to us.--------30
What love Thou hast bestowed on us,
We thank Thee from our heart;
Our Father, we would worship Thee
And praise for all Thou art.

Thy heart Thou hast revealed to us,
Made known th' eternal will;
Within the Son Thou hast come forth,
Thy purpose to fulfill.

Thou gavest Thy beloved Son
In love to come and die,
That we may be Thy many sons,
As heirs with Him, made nigh.

Through Him we have Thy very life
And Thou our Father art;
Thy very nature, all Thyself,
Thou dost to us impart.

Thy Spirit into ours has come
That we may "Abba" cry;
Of Spirit born, with Spirit sealed,
To be transformed thereby.

The many sons to glory brought
Is Thine eternal goal,
And to Thy Son's own image wrought,
Thou wilt conform the whole.

Throughout Thy transformation work
Thou dost direct each one,
From glory unto glory bring
Until the work is done.

What love Thou, Father, hast bestowed;
We'll ever grateful be;
We'll worship Thee forevermore
And praise unceasingly.--------31
All that we were  our sin, our guilt,
Our death  was all our own:
All that we are we owe to Thee,
Thou God of grace alone.

Thy mercy found us in our sins,
And gave us to believe;
Then, in believing, peace we found,
And in Thy Christ we live.

All that we are, as saints on earth,
All that we hope to be,
When Jesus comes and glory dawns,
We owe it all to Thee.

O God, how rich, how vast Thy love,
Whoe'er can Thee repay?
Thy love is past man's finding out,
Thy grace no man can say.

But Lord, to me I pray Thee grant,
More clearly may I see,
That I may e'er more fully know
How much I owe to Thee.

But if man's heart should e'er suppose
He could repay Thy love,
It only means he nothing knows
Of love, all loves above.

So may we never bargains make
With that dear love of Thine:
The love that made Thine heart once break,
Whoe'er that love could win?

Then nevermore suggest return,
His love is far too high;
But let our hearts with rapture burn
That He for us should die.

O Father God, we owe Thee all!
All that we are and have!
With grateful thanks before Thee fall,
'Tis all that we can give.--------32
We bow and worship, Father, here
And marvel at Thy wondrous love.
O what is man that Thou shouldst deign
To him such boundless grace to prove!

We praise Thee for Thy heart's intent
That man Thy likeness should possess,
That with Thy life and nature filled
Thine image he should manifest.

Man in Thine image Thou didst make,
To him authority didst give;
Thyself presenting as his life,
That by Thy riches he might live.

To enter man Thou dost desire,
With him to mingle thru Thy grace,
That man may be transformed and built
To be Thy worthy dwelling place.

Tho' man did fall, Thou didst not leave
Thy heart's intent, but Thou didst move;
Redeeming man to bring him back,
Thou didst Thy love and wisdom prove.

In Christ Thou didst Thyself reveal,
Who died and rose, redemption wrought;
In Spirit Thou hast entered man
And to him life and grace hast brought.

My spirit is Thy holiest place,
Thy throne of grace is founded there;
Thou wouldst that we in spirit come
To burn the incense thru our prayer.

Such grace is like a river full
Which from the throne of grace doth come;
It floweth thru, transforming us,
And builds us up to be Thy home.

Receiving of Thy matchless grace,
We marvel at Thy gift so free;
With grateful hearts for Thy great love,
In spirit now we worship Thee.--------33
Father, long before creation,
Thou hadst chosen us in love;
And that love, so deep, so moving,
Draws us close to Christ above,
And will keep us, and will keep us,
Firmly fixed in Christ alone,
Firmly fixed in Christ alone.

Though the world may change its fashion,
Yet our God is e'er the same;
His compassion and His cov'nant
Through all ages will remain.
God's own children, God's own children,
Must forever praise His name,
Must forever praise His name.

God's compassion is my story,
Is my boasting all the day;
Mercy free and never failing
Moves my will, directs my way.
God so loved us, God so loved us,
That His only Son He gave,
That His only Son He gave.

Loving Father, now before Thee
We will ever praise Thy love;
And our song will sound unceasing
Till we meet Thy Son above,
Giving glory, giving glory,
To our God and to the Lamb,
To our God and to the Lamb.--------34
Father, 'twas Thy love that knew us
Earth's foundation long before:
That same love to Jesus drew us
By its sweet constraining pow'r,
And will keep us, and will keep us,
Safely now, and evermore,
Safely now, and evermore.

Now that changeless love enfolds us,
All its wealth on us bestows;
While its pow'r unchanging holds us
In a holy calm repose.
God and Father, God and Father,
Unto Thee our worship flows,
Unto Thee our worship flows.

God of love, our souls adore Thee!
We would still Thy grace proclaim,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
And in glory praise Thy name;
Praise and worship, praise and worship
Be to God and to the Lamb!
Be to God and to the Lamb!--------35
Blest Father of glory, we worship:
Thy greatness surpasses our praise;
We bless Thee: Thy Spirit within us
Gives pow'r to these heavenly lays.

We think of the Man in Thy presence,
Set down there, exalted as Head;
Once raised by the might of Thy power,
When numbered along with the dead.

We think of the glory that chose us,
'Twas Thine, blessed Father, the Source;
The glory of love that redeemed us
Through Jesus, the Man of Thy choice.

As marked out beforehand for sonship,
We praise now the glory of grace
And bow in Thy presence and worship,
As conscious, in Christ, of our place.--------36
We praise Thee, glorious Father,
As objects of Thy grace,
Who for Thine own heart's pleasure
Are now before Thy face:
Thy sons marked out for glory
Known from eternity
With Christ Thy Well-beloved,
Object supreme to Thee.

Who else but Thee, O Father,
Could in Thine only Son
So bless us with Thy Spirit,
And have us for Thine own?
Soon shall we be forever
With Christ in glory; then
We'll shine in His blest image
Eternally, Amen!--------37
O God! We see Thee in the Lamb
To be our hope, our joy, our rest;
The glories that compose Thy name
Standing engaged to make us blest.

Thou great and good! Thou just and wise!
Hail! As our Father and our God!
For we are Thine by sacred ties,
Thy sons and daughters  bought with blood.

Then, Oh! To us this grace afford,
That far from Thee we ne'er may move;
Our guard  the presence of the Lord;
Our joy  Thy perfect present love.

This gives us ever to rejoice,
Turning to light our darkest days;
And lifts on high each feeble voice,
While we have breath to pray or praise.--------38
Of all the gifts Thy love bestows,
Thou Giver of all good!
E'en heav'n itself no richer knows
Than Jesus and His blood.

Faith, too, that trusts in Him through grace,
From that same love we gain;
Else, sweetly as it suits our case,
The gift had been in vain.

We praise Thee, and would praise Thee more,
To Thee our all we owe:
The precious Savior, and the power
That makes Him precious too.--------39
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
So Loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life our redemption to win,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the earth hear His voice;
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the people rejoice;
  Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
  And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.

Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the earth hear His voice;
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the people rejoice;
  Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
  And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.

Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the earth hear His voice;
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Let the people rejoice;
  Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
  And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.--------40
We praise Thee, O God,
For the Son of Thy love,
For our Savior who died and
Is now gone above.

  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  Hallelujah! Amen;
  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  We praise Thee again.

We praise Thee, O God,
For Thy Spirit of light,
Who has shown us our Savior,
And scattered our night.

  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  Hallelujah! Amen;
  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  We praise Thee again.

All glory and praise
To Thee, Father of love,
For through Jesus' redemption
Thy heart we may prove.

  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  Hallelujah! Amen;
  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  We praise Thee again.

We praise Thee again;
We are filled with Thy love,
And each heart is rekindled
With fire from above.

  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  Hallelujah! Amen;
  Hallelujah! Thine the glory,
  We praise Thee again.--------41
We are never weary singing our eternal song:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We would sing His praise forever with our spirit strong:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

  O the children of the Lord have a wondrous song to sing,
  For the Lord will by His grace many sons to glory bring.
  We are going in that day to the presence of the King:
  Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We are seeking every moment all its grace to prove:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

  O the children of the Lord have a wondrous song to sing,
  For the Lord will by His grace many sons to glory bring.
  We are going in that day to the presence of the King:
  Glory to God, hallelujah!

We are going on to glory as the Lord has told:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His beauty we shall soon behold:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

  O the children of the Lord have a wondrous song to sing,
  For the Lord will by His grace many sons to glory bring.
  We are going in that day to the presence of the King:
  Glory to God, hallelujah!

There we'll sing His grace and mercy in a glad new song:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
There we'll praise our glorious Savior with the blessed throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

  O the children of the Lord have a wondrous song to sing,
  For the Lord will by His grace many sons to glory bring.
  We are going in that day to the presence of the King:
  Glory to God, hallelujah!--------42
By Thee, O God, invited,
We look unto the Son,
In whom Thy heart delighted,
Who all Thy will hath done;
And by the one chief treasure
Thy bosom freely gave,
Thine own pure love we measure,
Thy willing mind to save.

O God of mercy  Father!
The one unchanging claim,
The brightest hopes, we gather
From Christ's most precious name:
What always sounds so sweetly
In Thine unwearied ear,
Has freed our souls completely
From all our guilt and fear.

The trembling sinner feareth
That God can ne'er forget;
But one full payment cleareth
His memory of all debt.
When nought beside could free us,
Or set our souls at large,
The death of God's Beloved
Secured a full discharge.

No wrath God's heart retaineth
To usward who believe;
No dread in ours remaineth
As we His love receive;
Returning sons He kisses,
And with His robe invests;
His perfect love dismisses
All terror from our breasts.--------43
"Abba, Father," we approach Thee
In our Savior's precious name.
We, Thy children, here assembling,
Now the promised blessing claim.
From our guilt His blood has washed us,
'Tis through Him our souls draw nigh,
And Thy Spirit too has taught us
"Abba, Father," thus to cry.

Once as prodigals we wandered,
In our folly, far from Thee;
But Thy grace, o'er sin abounding,
Rescued us from misery.
Clothed in garments of salvation
At Thy table is our place;
We rejoice, and Thou rejoicest,
In the riches of Thy grace.

Thou the prodigal hast pardoned,
"Kissed us" with a Father's love;
"Killed the fatted calf," and made us
Fit Thy purpose to approve.
"It is meet," we hear Thee saying,
"We should merry be and glad;
I have found My once-lost children,
Now they live who once were dead."

"Abba, Father," we adore Thee,
While the hosts in heaven above
E'en in us now learn the wonders
Of Thy wisdom, grace, and love.
Soon before Thy throne assembled,
All Thy children shall proclaim
Abba's love shown in redemption,
And how full is Abba's name!--------44
O Holy Father, who in tender love
Didst give Thine only Son for us to die,
The while He pleads at Thy right hand above,
We in one Spirit now with faith draw nigh;
And, as we eat this bread and drink this wine,
Plead His once offered sacrifice Divine.

We are not worthy to be called Thy sons,
Nor gather up the fragments of Thy feast;
Yet look on us, Thy sorrowing contrite ones,
On us in Him our Advocate and Priest,
Whose robe is fringed with mercy's golden bells,
Whose breastplate fathomless compassion tells.

Oh, hear us, for Thou always hearest Him;
Behold us sprinkled with His precious blood;
And from between the shadowing cherubim
Shine forth, and grant us by this heav'nly food
Foretastes of coming glory, and meanwhile
A Father's blessing and a Father's smile.

And, Father, ere we leave Thy mercy-throne,
Bound by these sacred pledges, yet most free,
We give our hearts, and not our hearts alone,
But all we are and all we have to Thee;
Glad free-will offerings all our pilgrim days,
Hereafter an eternity of praise.--------45
Abba, Father! We adore Thee,
Humbly now our homage pay;
'Tis Thy children's bliss to know Thee,
None but children "Abba" say.
This high honor we inherit,
Thy free gift through Jesus' blood;
God the Spirit, with our spirit,
Witnesseth we're sons of God.

Thine own purpose gave us being,
When in Christ, in that vast plan,
Thou in Christ didst choose Thy people
E'en before the world began.
Oh, what love Thou, Father, bore us!
Oh, how precious in Thy sight!
When to Thine own Son Thou gav'st us,
To Thy Son, Thy soul's delight.

Though our nature's fall in Adam
Shut us wholly out from God,
Thine eternal counsel brought us
Nearer still, through Jesus' blood;
For in Him we found redemption,
Grace and glory in Thy Son;
O the height and depth of mercy!
Christ and His redeemed are one.

Hence, through all the changing seasons,
Trouble, sickness, sorrow, woe,
Nothing changeth Thine affections,
Love divine shall bring us through;
Soon shall all Thy blood-bought children
Round the throne their anthems raise,
And, in songs of rich salvation,
Shout to Thine eternal praise.--------46
O gracious God, Thy pleasure
Is in Thy Christ made known,
And tells the boundless measure
Of blessing for Thine own.
He has Thy presence entered,
As Man in heav'n is known;
In Him Thy glory's centered,
In Him Thy purpose shown.

And O what love is beaming
Refulgent in that face!
What blessed light is streaming
From that most glorious place!
Both love and light proclaiming
What Thou, the Father, art,
And wondrous grace revealing,
With Thine own Son, our part.

Thou source of every blessing!
Thou spring of all delight!
Thy Name with joy confessing
Let all the saints unite!
Each heart its praise outpouring
To Thee all praise above,
Each voice in strains adoring
Re-echoes  "God is love."--------47
Father, Thy name our souls would bless,
As children taught by grace,
Lift up our hearts in righteousness,
And joy before Thy face.

Sweet is the confidence Thou giv'st,
Though high above our praise;
Our hearts resort to where Thou liv'st
In heaven's unclouded rays.

Eternal ages shall declare
The riches of Thy grace,
To those who with Thy Son shall share
A son's eternal place.

Absent as yet, we rest in hope,
Treading the desert path,
Waiting for Him who takes us up
Beyond the pow'r of death.

We joy in Thee, Thy fulness shall
Our endless portion be,
Like Thine own Son, with whom we'll dwell
In bright eternity.

O Holy Father, keep us here
In that blest name of love,
Walking before Thee without fear,
Thy perfect will to prove.--------48
We bless Thee, God and Father,
We joy before Thy face;
Beyond dark death for ever,
We share Thy Son's blest place.
He lives a Man before Thee,
In cloudless light above,
In Thine unbounded favor,
Thine everlasting love.

His Father and our Father,
His God and ours Thou art;
And He is Thy Beloved,
The gladness of Thy heart.
We're His, in joy He brings us
To share His part and place,
To know Thy love and favor,
The shining of Thy face.

Thy love that now enfolds us
Can ne'er wax cold or dim;
In Him that love doth center,
And we are loved in Him.
In Him Thy love and glory
Find their eternal rest;
The many sons  His brethren
In Him, how near, how blest!--------49
Gracious God, we worship Thee,
Rev'rently we bow the knee;
Jesus Christ, our only plea:
Father, we adore Thee.

Vast Thy love, how deep, how wide,
In the gift of Him who died;
Righteous claims all satisfied:
Father, we adore Thee.

Low we bow before Thy face,
Sons of God, O wondrous place;
Great the riches of Thy grace:
Father, we adore Thee.

By Thy Spirit grant that we
Worshipers in truth may be;
Praise, as incense sweet to Thee:
Father, we adore Thee.

Yet again our song we raise,
Note of deep adoring praise;
Now, and soon through endless days:
Father, we adore Thee.--------50
Father, Thy Son beloved leads our praise
After the banquet feast is had and done;
How dear, how sweet to Thee the praise He leads,
And in His praises joining we are one.

Father, we need no goodness more than Thee,
Nor do we seek a love that's less than Thine;
How we adore Thee now that here we know
Thy searchless, uncreated life divine.

Father, within Thy love our love to Thee
Grows, far transcending all our earthly ties;
Thine own dear love in power leads our hearts
Where Thine own presence deeply satisfies.

Father, by joining with Thy Son beloved,
We all with gladness praise Thee now again;
Joyfully feasting on Thy holy love,
Tasting, as sons, the sweetness of Thy name.--------51
Our God and Father, we respond to Thee
As sons brought near,
Suited, in love and holy liberty,
To this blest sphere.
O wondrous thought, that many there should be
Like Christ, for Thy delight eternally!

He, Thy delight, in whom we have our part,
Through grace to share
Thy love for Him, the Object of Thy heart
Beyond compare.
His glory in Thy presence now we see,
As with Him there in love's complacency.

'Tis here He sings  what joy His heart doth find,
Thyself to praise,
While many sons are stirred in heart and mind
One voice to raise
In worship, God and Father, unto Thee,
Supreme, Thou Source in love's economy!--------52
Father, to Thee a joyful song we raise
With all Thine own;
And in Thy presence sound a note of praise
To Thee alone;
Bro't nigh, bro't home to Thee  O wondrous grace,
That gives us now with Thine own Son our place.

How deep the holy joy that fills that scene,
Where love is known!
Thy love, our God and Father, now is seen,
In Him alone;
As, in the holy calm of Thine own rest,
He leads the praise of those Thy love has blessed.

He leads the praise! How precious to Thine ear
The song He sings!
How precious, too, to Thee  How near how dear
Are those He brings
To share His place: 'twas thus that Thou didst plan;
Thou lovedst Him before the world began.--------53
Our God and Father, we respond anew
To love in Christ revealed, and praise Thy Name.
He did Thy will; and for the joy in view,
Endured the cross, despising all the shame.

He, midst His brethren, strikes the note of praise;
We hear His song, our hearts responsive swell;
And on this day when He His voice doth raise,
In spirit we do join and praise Thee well.

Chosen in Him, Thy well-beloved Son,
We have our part in joy before Thy face;
Predestined, ere this world had yet begun,
For that blest world, where all bespeaks Thy grace.

Sons loved and loving, whom Thy Spirit fills,
Our endless portion Christ in us to be;
Each with some trait of Him whose love us thrills,
For Thy delight and joy eternally.--------54
O God and Father, we our praises bring,
For who more worthy of our praise could be
Than Thou, who seekest worshipers who sing
In spirit and in truth adoringly!

All worlds Thou hast created by the Son,
All things are held by His unmeasured power;
Yet we approach Thee in that glorious One:
What cause for worship in this holy hour!

'Tis He who leads us in this blessed sphere,
In the assembly singing praise to Thee;
What joy to Him that we should thus be near
As suited and in perfect liberty!

Here we unite, our song of joy is one!
And Thou, O God, art fully satisfied.
Amidst the praises led by Christ, Thy Son,
Thou hast a dwelling ever to abide.--------55
O God our Father, we would come to Thee
In virtue of our Savior's precious blood;
All distance gone, our souls by grace set free,
We worship Thee, our Father and our God.

We would, O God, present before Thy face
The fragrant name of Thy beloved Son;
By faith we view Him through Thy boundless grace,
Which, by His dying, He for us has won.

Thy joy in Him who is with Thee we share;
Our hearts delight in Thy delight in Him;
Chiefest of thousands, fairer than the fair;
His glory nought can tarnish, nought can dim.

We bow in worship now before Thy throne,
By faith the Object of Thy love would see;
Who, in the midst, His brethren's song doth lead.
To Him, our Savior, shall the glory be!--------56
Dear Lord, Thou art the Word of God,
Thou art God's very Son;
Thou art His holy image true,
And with Him ever one.

Thou art Thyself the very God,
Thou dost embody Him;
In Thee is manifested God,
And we see God therein.

Effulgence of God's glory, Thou,
By Thee God shines on us;
Expression of His substance, Thou,
In Thee He's real to us.

In Thee God is the life to us,
In Thee He is the light;
In Thee His nature we partake
And with Him we unite.

In Thee the grace of God subsists,
God we enjoy in Thee;
His truth in Thee is also found,
His full reality.

In Thee God's fulness we receive,
Which fills from grace to grace;
In Thee with God we're mingled here,
Till one in every phase.

O Lord our God, we worship Thee,
In Thee we have our all;
Thyself we treasure in our heart,
Thy Name we love to call.--------57
The image of the Father God,
Lord, we behold in Thee;
The fulness of the Godhead true
In Thee dwells bodily.

Lord, Thou art God's eternal Word
With life divine in Thee;
In Thee His grace we all receive
With His reality.

Effulgence of God's glory true,
The Son of God art Thou;
The very substance of Himself
In Thee we all avow.

Embodiment of God Thou art,
And with Him ever one;
In Thee is God expressed to us
Beyond comparison.

God we enjoy in Thee, dear Lord,
As life and everything;
To Thee and God our heartfelt thanks
And praise we'll ever bring.--------58
Thou art the living Word, O Lord,
Which ever was with God;
His glory Thou hast fully shown
When Thou on earth hast trod.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

The heavens do God's glory speak,
Creation vast doth show
The things of God, His character
And pow'r for man to know.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

The Word of God  how rich, profound,
His testimony shown;
Within the Word Thou art declared,
That God should be made known.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

Thou, living Word, didst flesh become,
With man on earth hast trod;
And all Thy words and conduct here
Expression gave to God.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

O living Word, Thou art the life,
Thou art the living light;
As life Thou dost illuminate
The Father to our sight.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

God's judgment Thou wilt yet perform,
His righteousness make known;
This also doth expression give
That God be fully shown.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.

God's full expression, Lord, Thou art,
Himself Thou hast revealed;
Declaring all He is to man,
No more is God concealed.

  We praise Thee, O Thou living Word,
  For God in Thee we see;
  His glory and His character
  Are all revealed by Thee.--------59
Thou art the everlasting Word,
The Father's only Son,
God manifestly seen and heard,
And heav'n's beloved One:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.

In Thee most perfectly expressed
The Father's glories shine;
Of the full Deity possessed,
Eternally divine:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.

True image of the Infinite,
Whose essence is concealed;
Brightness of uncreated light;
The heart of God revealed:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.

But the, high mysteries of Thy Name
An angel's grasp transcend;
The Father only, glorious claim!
The Son can comprehend:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.

Throughout the universe of bliss,
The center, Thou, and sun;
Th' eternal theme of praise is this,
To heav'n's beloved One:
Divine, O Son of God, art Thou,
In Thee God's fulness find we now.--------60
Of the Father's love begotten,
Ere the worlds began to be,
He is Alpha and Omega,
He the source, the ending He,
Of the things that are and have been,
And that future years shall see,
Evermore and evermore.

This is He whom they in old time
Chanted of with one accord,
Whom the voices of the prophets
Promised in their faithful word;
Now He shines, the long-expected;
Let creation praise its Lord,
Evermore and evermore.

O ye heights of heav'n, adore Him;
Angel hosts, His praises sing;
All dominions, bow before Him,
And extol our Lord and King.
Let no tongue on earth be silent,
Every voice in concert ring,
Evermore and evermore.

Christ, to Thee, with God the Father,
And, with Holy Ghost, to Thee,
Hymn and chant and high thanksgiving,
And unwearied praises be;
Honor, glory, and dominion,
And eternal victory,
Evermore and evermore.--------61
O Lord, Thou art the Son of man,
Our human nature Thou didst take;
Begotten of a virgin true,
Of flesh and blood Thou didst partake.

In bondman's form, with lowliness,
Thou walkedst on this earth of woe;
The human living Thou didst have
And all its suff'rings undergo.

Born in a manger as a babe,
Thou wast a child among the poor;
Thou as a carpenter didst work,
And e'en an outlaw's death endure.

Then Thou wast raised up from the dead,
Still with the human nature true;
And as a man in form divine,
Thou didst ascend to heaven too.

Now over all, and on the throne,
Thou, still a man, art glorified;
A man with God in light divine
With whom our God is satisfied.

In glory Thou wilt come again,
Still as a man appearing then;
As King of kings, with pow'r divine,
With human nature seen by men.

Thou, as the center of all things,
In the new heav'n and earth shalt be,
Forever as the One divine,
Existing in humanity.--------62
Dear Lord Jesus, we adore Thee,
"Seed of woman" Thou became;
Of the virgin wast begotten,
Called e'en with a human name.
Taking thus the human nature,
Thou as man the serpent trod;
By the Cross his head Thou bruisd
And fulfilled the plan of God.

  Lord, we see Thy glory,
  Shown in human beauty,
  Full of splendor, manifested
  In humanity.

As a man, by incarnation,
Flesh and blood didst Thou partake
To destroy the devil, Satan,
In our stead and for our sake.
With the name of Jesus given
And Emmanuel calld too,
Thou becam'st our precious Savior,
Bringing us salvation true.

  Lord, we see Thy glory,
  Shown in human beauty,
  Full of splendor, manifested
  In humanity.

Thou, "Last Adam" wast entitled,
And wast called the "second man",
Head of all the new creation,
Better than the first man.
On this earth in life and conduct
Thou indeed wast Son of man;
Now in heaven with this nature
Thou dost still appear as man.

  Lord, we see Thy glory,
  Shown in human beauty,
  Full of splendor, manifested
  In humanity.

In the time which God appointed
Thou wilt come, dear Lord, again,
With the glory of the Father,
Still appearing as a man.
Even on the throne of judgment
Son of man Thou still wilt be;
And with this, our human nature,
Thou forevermore wilt be.

  Lord, we see Thy glory,
  Shown in human beauty,
  Full of splendor, manifested
  In humanity.--------63
Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
Most sure in all His ways.

O loving wisdom of our God,
When all was sin and shame,
He, the last Adam, to the fight
And to the rescue came.

O wisest love! That flesh and blood
Which did in Adam fail,
Should strive afresh against the foe,
Should strive and should prevail.

And that a higher gift than grace
Should flesh and blood refine,
God's presence, and His very self
And essence all-divine.

O generous love! That He, who smote
In man for man the foe,
The double agony in man
For man should undergo.

And in the garden secretly,
And on the cross on high,
Should teach His brethren, and inspire
To suffer and to die.

Praise to the Holiest in the height,
And in the depth be praise:
In all His words most wonderful;
Most sure in all His ways.--------64
O soul-inspiring story
God's majesty and grace
In lustrous strokes of glory
Deep-carved in Jesus' face!
Hearts rapt in contemplation
Of Godhead's Image bright,
Break forth in adoration,
In wonder and delight!

There Manhood, all perfection,
And Godhead-fulness shine;
God's love and Man's affection,
The human, the divine;
A life, a death, transcendent,
Revealing God as love:
Here, lowly Man, dependent
God over all, above!

Unsullied blaze of glory!
O ever-radiant Face!
Thy rich, unfathomed story
Transfigures us in grace!
Made like Thee, soon, completely,
With love-lit eyes we'll scan
God's face unveiled so sweetly
In Thine, Thou Son of man!--------65
Jesus! That name we love,
Jesus, our Lord!
Jesus, all names above,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou, Lord, our all must be;
Nothing that's good have we,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!

As Son of Man it was,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou gav'st Thy life for us,
Jesus, our Lord!
Great was indeed Thy love,
All other loves above,
Love Thou didst dearly prove,
Jesus, our Lord!

Righteous alone in Thee,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou wilt a refuge be,
Jesus, our Lord!
Whom, then, have we to fear,
What trouble, grief, or care,
Since Thou art ever near,
Jesus, our Lord!

Soon Thou wilt come again,
Jesus, the Lord!
We shall be happy then,
Jesus, our Lord!
When Thine own face we see,
Then shall we like Thee be,
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!--------66
  For each verse, repeat last line twice, then repeat last two lines

How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer's ear!
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
'Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

Dear Name! The Rock on which we build;
Our shield and hiding-place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,
Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
Accept the praise we bring.

Weak is the effort of our heart,
And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We'll praise Thee as we ought.

Till then we would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in that blessed Name
Which quells the pow'r of death.--------67
The name of Jesus is so sweet,
I love its music to repeat;
It makes my joys full and complete,
The precious name of Jesus.

  Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,
  Jesus! Every day the same;
  Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
  Its worthy praise forever.

I love the name of Him whose heart
Knows all my griefs and bears a part;
Who bids all anxious fears depart,
I love the name of Jesus.

  Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,
  Jesus! Every day the same;
  Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
  Its worthy praise forever.

That name I fondly love to hear,
It never fails my heart to cheer,
Its music dries the falling tear;
Exalt the name of Jesus.

  Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,
  Jesus! Every day the same;
  Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
  Its worthy praise forever.

No word of man can ever tell
How sweet the name I love so well,
Oh, let its praises ever swell,
Oh, praise the name of Jesus.

  Jesus! Oh, how sweet the name,
  Jesus! Every day the same;
  Jesus! Let all saints proclaim
  Its worthy praise forever.--------68
Lord, Thy Name is calld Jesus,
Wonderful is this dear Name;
Thou wast brought forth of the virgin,
And the Son of man became.
Thou art our Jehovah-Savior,
Saving us from all our sins;
When as Savior we receive Thee,
Life divine in us begins.

Thou as "Christ" art also titled,
Title of Thy ministry;
Thou art truly God's anointed,
Even from eternity.
Thou, O Lord, art God's Messiah;
God appointed Thee in love,
That Thou might fulfill His purpose
And to all His glory prove.

Thou art also, called "Emmanuel";
"God with us" Thou cam'st to be;
God in grace is wholly mingled
With our own humanity.
God in flesh is manifested,
Full of grace and truth therein;
We have seen in Thee God's glory,
And in faith partake of Him.

How we treasure all Thy names, Lord,
How much they to us unfold;
All their worth and all their sweetness
We in love will ever hold.
Precious Savior, we adore Thee,
Worship unto Thee we bring;
Our Emmanuel we exalt Thee,
And Thy praise will ever sing.--------69
Thy name we love, Lord Jesus,
And lowly bow before Thee;
And while we live, to Thee we give
All blessing, worship, glory.
We sing aloud Thy praises,
Our hearts and voices blending,
'Tis Thou alone we worthy own,
Thy beauty's all-transcending.

Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells God's love unbounded
To ruined man, ere time began,
Or heav'n and earth were founded:
Thine is a love eternal,
That found in us its pleasure,
That brought Thee low to bear our woe
And make us Thine own treasure.

Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
It tells Thy birth so lowly,
Thy patience, grace, and gentleness,
Thy lonely path, so holy;
Thou wast the "Man of Sorrows";
Our grief, too, Thou didst bear it;
Our bitter cup Thou drankest up;
The thorny crown, didst wear it.

Thy name we love, Lord Jesus;
God's Lamb  Thou wast ordained,
To bear our sins (Thyself all clean)
And hast our guilt sustained.
We see Thee crowned in glory,
Above the heavens now seated,
The vict'ry won, Thy work well done,
Our righteousness completed.--------70
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth;
It sounds like music in mine ear,
The sweetest name on earth.

  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Because He first loved me!

It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner's perfect plea.

  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Because He first loved me!

It tells me what my Father hath,
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Because He first loved me!

It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.

  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Oh, how I love Jesus,
  Because He first loved me!--------71
Jesus! How much Thy name unfolds
To every opened ear;
The pardoned sinner's mem'ry holds
None other half so dear.

Thy name encircles every grace
That God as man could show;
There only could He fully trace
A life divine below.

Jesus  it speaks a life of love,
Of sorrows meekly borne;
It tells of sympathy above.
Whatever makes us mourn.

Jesus, the One who knew no sin,
Made sin to make us just;
Thou gav'st Thyself our love to win,
Our full confiding trust.

The mention of Thy name shall bow
Our hearts to worship Thee;
The chiefest of ten thousand Thou,
Whose love has set us free.--------72
Jesus, the name high over all,
In hell, or earth, or sky:
Angels and men before it fall,
And devils fear and fly.

Jesus, the name to sinners dear,
The name to sinners giv'n;
It scatters all their guilty fear,
It brings them peace of heav'n.

Jesus the prisoner's fetters breaks,
And bruises Satan's head;
Pow'r into strengthless souls He speaks,
And life into the dead.

Oh, that the world might taste and see,
The riches of His grace!
The arms of love that compass me,
Would all mankind embrace.

Him as my righteousness I show,
His saving truth proclaim:
'Tis all my business here below,
To cry, Behold the Lamb!

Happy, if with my latest breath
I may but gasp His name:
Preach Him to all, and cry in death,
"Behold, behold the Lamb!"--------73
Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,
Into Thy dear Name I flee;
"Set aloft," I praise and worship,
For Thy Name is victory!

Blessed Jesus! Mighty Savior!
In Thy Name is all I need;
Just to breathe the Name of Jesus,
Is to drink of Life indeed.

Glorious, mighty Name of Jesus,
Heav'n and earth its pow'r proclaim;
But forgiven sinners only,
Know the balm of Jesus' Name.

Jesus! Jesus! Name most precious,
Balm in pain or mighty sword;
In Thy Name, we live and conquer,
Blessed, glorious, coming Lord.--------74
There is a name to Jesus given,
His matchless love its accents tell;
For it declares: He is my Brother,
And this His name  Emmanuel!
The Lord, by angels worshiped yonder,
Has stooped to earth with men to dwell,
Incarnate God, and man forever
Our own beloved Emmanuel.

There is a name that's still more precious,
That stirs our hearts with fondest love:
It is the charming name of Jesus,
The name all other names above.
It tells me that He is my Savior
From sin and sickness and the grave.
I love the precious name of Jesus,
For I am one He came to save!

Though dear to us the name of Jesus,
The name of Christ is higher still!
It tells of Him who dwells within us,
Our old heart to renew and fill.
It tells me of the Spirit's fullness,
It brings the pow'r of Pentecost.
O blessed Christ, anoint me also,
And fill me with the Holy Ghost!--------75
Jesus, Name of matchless splendor!
Name all other names above!
Glorious Son of God incarnate,
King of kings, and Lord of love!

Name that to our hearts is nearest,
Here the stricken soul doth hide;
Name that to our hearts is dearest,
As in Jesus we confide.

"Call Him Jesus!" He shall save us
From the tyranny of sin;
From its condemnation save us,
From iniquity within.

Thanks we give, and adoration,
Every day and every hour,
For an uttermost salvation,
Freedom from sin's guilt and power.

Jesus! Sweetest note of any
In the lowly pilgrim's song;
Jesus! The triumphant music
Of the bright angelic throng.

Earth to Him her face upraises,
Knows Him as the great I AM!
Heaven resounds with Jesus' praises,
Glory to the bleeding Lamb!--------76
In the Name of Jesus
Every knee shall bow,
Every tongue confess Him
King of glory now;
'Tis the Father's pleasure
We should call Him Lord,
Who from the beginning
Was the Mighty Word.

At His voice creation
Sprang at once to sight:
All the angel faces,
All the hosts of light,
Thrones and dominations,
Stars upon their way,
All the heav'nly orders,
In their great array.

Humbled for a season,
To receive a Name
From the lips of sinners
Unto whom He came,
Faithfully He bore it
Spotless to the last,
Brought it back victorious,
When from death He passed;

Bore it up triumphant,
With its human light,
Through all ranks of creatures,
To the central height;
To the throne of Godhead,
To the Father's breast,
Filled it with the glory
Of that perfect rest.

Name Him, brothers, name Him,
With love strong as death,
But with awe and wonder,
And with bated breath;
He is God the Savior,
He is Christ the Lord,
Ever to be worshiped,
Trusted, and adored.

In your hearts enthrone Him;
There let Him subdue
All that is not holy,
All that is not true;
Crown Him as your Captain
In temptation's hour;
Let His will enfold you
In its light and power.

Brothers, this Lord Jesus
Shall return again,
With His Father's glory,
With His angel train;
For all wreaths of empire
Meet upon His brow,
And our hearts confess Him
King of glory now.--------77
Lift that Name high! That glorious Name,
Let heav'n and earth its pow'r proclaim;
Our mighty, conqu'ring, coming King,
Earth yet shall with His praises ring.

Lift that Name high! To that high tower
We flee in every trial hour,
Safe, sheltered, satisfied and free,
For Jesus' Name is victory.

Lift that Name high! Until one day
His mighty Name the earth shall sway,
And sin and death, distress and pain
Shall be no more, for Christ shall reign.

Lift that Name high! Jesus shall reign,
And kings shall follow in His train;
Lift that Name high, all names above,
The Name of Him we own and love.

Lift that Name high! For every knee
Shall bow to Him; Jesus shall see
Fruit of His Cross, when earth shall bring
Her tribute to her Lord and King.--------78
Gracious Lord, Thy name "I AM" is,
Precious name, how rich and full 'tis,
All-inclusive, faithful too 'tis
All, we need, Thou art!

Thou the Son, the Father in Thee,
As the Spirit now indwell me,
That the riches of Thyself we
May experience.

Thou the Temple for God's dwelling,
Thou the Father's life e'er telling;
We in Thee with joy excelling
Face to face see Him.

Thou the Lamb and Thou the Bridegroom,
For the bride Thou sufferedst sin's doom,
Wounded, crucified in our room;
Thus we find our rest.

Thou art wisdom and the way, Lord,
Thou our lives dost plan each day, Lord,
Grace to us Thou dost convey, Lord,
In Thy path to walk.

Pure and holy, righteous Thou art,
One with God, well-pleasing His heart,
Thou within to us dost impart
Harmony with God.

Thou art life and Thou art light, Lord,
Death hast swallowed, banished night, Lord,
Thou hast quickened, given sight, Lord;
We are now set free.

Thou art resurrection power,
Thou the conqu'ror in hell's hour;
Thou dost us with might empower
Over all to reign.

Living water, food supply, Lord,
Thou Thyself art, and didst die, Lord,
All our want to satisfy, Lord;
Now we feast on Thee.

10 Thou the Shepherd and Physician,
Thou hast healed our sick condition;
Comfort, guide, protect  Thy mission;
Thou dost care for us.

11 Priest and King Thou art fore'er, Lord;
Into God we're brought, and there, Lord,
Thine authority we share, Lord;
What an honored place!

12 Thou our Hope and our Redemption,
Thou wilt change our old creation,
Make of Thee a duplication,
Thus Thyself express.

13 Thou our Joy, our Peace, our Glory;
Truth, and Grace, the Rock, the Life-tree,
Building, Mountain, Sun, and Shield  we
Ne'er can tell it all.

14 What Thou art  eternal, boundless,
Full and perfect, rich, exhaustless
Meets our need to utter fullness
And from us o'erflows.--------79
All praise to Him who reigns on high,
In majesty supreme,
Who gave His life for man to die, That He
might man redeem.

  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name above all names shall stand,
Exalted more and more,
At God the Father's own right hand,
Where angel hosts adore.

  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.

Redeemer, Savior, Friend of man
Once ruined by the fall,
Thou hast devised salvation's plan,
For Thou hast died for all.

  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.

His name shall be the Counselor,
The mighty Prince of Peace,
Of all earth's kingdoms, Conqueror,
Whose reign shall never cease.

  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name,
  Blessed be the name of the Lord.--------80
Join all the glorious names
Of wisdom, love, and pow'r,
That mortals ever knew,
That angels ever bore;
All are too mean to speak His worth,
Too mean to set my Savior forth.

Great Prophet of my God,
My tongue would bless Thy name;
By Thee the joyful news
Of our salvation came;
The joyful news of sins forgiv'n,
Of death annulled, and Thy life giv'n.

Jesus, my great High Priest,
Offered His blood, and died;
My guilty conscience seeks
No sacrifice beside:
His pow'rful blood did me redeem,
'Tis worthy of my heart's esteem.

I love my Shepherd's voice:
His watchful eye shall keep
My wand'ring soul among
The thousands of His sheep:
He feeds His flock, He calls their names,
His bosom bears the tender lambs.

My Savior and my Lord,
My Conqu'ror and my King,
Thy scepter and Thy sword,
Thy reigning grace I sing:
Thine is the pow'r; behold I sit
In willing bonds beneath Thy feet.--------81
O Lord, Thy being is of old,
Before th' eternal past began!
For Thou th' eternal Father art,
The uncreated, great I AM!

Although a man with men become,
Yet Thou with God eternal art!
The same completeness Thou dost share,
And infinite as God Thou art!

Thine origin, the same as God,
Before creation was decreed!
Before the foremost, Thou art first,
None other doth Thyself precede!

Thou never changest thru all time,
Thy years are to eternity!
None is as lasting as Thyself,
Nor is there any after Thee!

Just as the Father, diff'ring not,
The same perfection Thou too hast!
Thou art the Alpha and the First,
Thou art Omega and the Last!

We praise Thee for Thine endless years,
Extol Thee for Thy perfectness!
Admiring all Thy fulness vast,
We marvel at Thy boundlessness!--------82
Down from His glory,
Ever living story,
My God and Savior came,
And Jesus was His name.
Born in a manger,
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, tears and agony.

  O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
  My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
  The great Creator became my Savior,
  And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.

What condescension,
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.

  O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
  My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
  The great Creator became my Savior,
  And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.

Without reluctance,
Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst'ry,
Sacrifice of Calv'ry,
And now I know Thou art the great "I AM."

  O how I love Him! How I adore Him!
  My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!
  The great Creator became my Savior,
  And all God's fulness dwelleth in Him.--------83
Hark! What mean those holy voices
Sweetly sounding in the skies?
Lo! th' angelic host rejoices,
Loudest hallelujahs rise.

Listen to the wondrous story
Which they chant in hymns of joy:
"Glory in the highest, glory!
Glory be to God most high!

"Peace on earth, good-will from heaven,
Reaching far as man is found;
Souls redeemed and sins forgiven,
Loud our golden harps shall sound.

"Christ is born! The great Anointed!
Heaven and earth His glory sing;
Oh, receive whom God appointed
For your Prophet, Priest, and King!

"Hasten, mortals, to adore Him
Learn His name and taste His joy,
Till one day ye sing before Him
Glory be to God most high! "

Let us learn the wondrous story
Of our great Redeemer's birth;
Spread the brightness of His glory,
Till it cover all the earth.--------84
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Hark! The herald angels sing,
"Glory to the new-born King;
Peace on earth, and mercy mild;
God and sinners reconciled."
Joyful, all ye nations, rise,
Join the triumph of the skies;
With angelic hosts proclaim,
"Christ is born in Bethlehem."

Christ, by highest heav'n adored,
Christ, the everlasting Lord:
Late in time behold Him come,
Offspring of a virgin's womb.
Veiled in flesh the Godhead see,
Hail th' incarnate Deity!
Pleased as man with man to dwell,
Jesus our Immanuel.

Hail the heav'n-born Prince of Peace!
Hail the Sun of righteousness!
Light and life to all He brings,
Ris'n with healing in His wings:
Mild He lays His glory by,
Born that man no more may die;
Born to raise the sons of earth;
Born to give them second birth.

Come, Desire of nations, come!
Fix in us Thy humble home:
Rise, the woman's conqu'ring seed,
Bruise in us the serpent's head;
Adam's likeness now efface,
Stamp Thine image in its place:
Final Adam from above,
Reinstate us in Thy love.--------85
O come, all ye faithful! Joyfully triumphant,
To Bethlehem hasten now with glad accord;
Lo! In a manger lies the God Almighty;

  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord!

Raise, raise choirs of angels, songs of loudest triumph,
Through heaven's high arches be your praises poured:
Now to our God be glory in the highest;

  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord!

Amen! Lord, we bless Thee, born for our salvation!
O Jesus! forever be Thy Name adored;
Word of the Father, late in flesh appearing;

  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  O come, let us adore Him,
  Christ the Lord!--------86
Though Thou art God, most glorious, high,
Thou in the flesh to us came nigh,
A lowly man become thereby;
Lord, I remember Thee!

Glory divine was put away
Under the tent of flesh to stay,
No outward beauty to display;
Lord, I remember Thee!

Thou art a root from out dry ground,
Thou wast the Man of sorrows found,
Hated, despised by man around;
Lord, I remember Thee!

Gentle and lowly is Thy heart,
Willing to suffer all Thou art,
To God and man complaining not;
Lord, I remember Thee!

Thou as a man art tender, sweet,
Balanced in every way, complete,
Meal-offering to the Father meet;
Lord, I remember Thee!

Doing the Father's will Thy prize,
Never accepting Satan's lies,
None like Thyself, so faithful, wise;
Lord, I remember Thee!

For Thine obedience to God's will,
Willing to suffer deathly ill,
E'en on the Cross my place to fill,
Lord, I remember Thee!

Therefore hath God exalted Thee,
Given Thee glory, majesty,
Heaven and earth will bow the knee;
O Lord, I worship Thee!--------87
O Lord! When we the path retrace
Which Thou on earth hast trod,
To men Thy wondrous love and grace,
Thy faithfulness to God;

Thy love, by man so sorely tried,
Proved stronger than the grave;
The very spear that pierced Thy side
Drew forth the blood to save;

Though Thou didst pass through woes and grief,
Thy works were ever good;
Although midst sorrows all Thy life,
Thou spak'st no murmuring word.

Faithful amidst unfaithfulness,
'Mid darkness only light,
Thou didst Thy Father's name confess,
And in His will delight;

Unmoved by Satan's subtle wiles,
Or, suffering, shame, and loss,
Thy path, uncheered by earthly smiles,
Led only to the cross.

We wonder at Thy lowly mind,
And fain would like Thee be,
And all our rest and pleasure find
In learning, Lord, of Thee.--------88
How beauteous were the marks divine,
That in Thy meekness used to shine,
That lit Thy lonely pathway, trod
In wondrous love, O Son of God!

O who like Thee, so mild, so bright,
Thou Son of man, Thou Light of light?
O who like Thee did ever go
So patient, through a world of woe?

O who like Thee so humbly bore
The scorn, the scoffs of men, before?
So meek, so lowly, yet so high,
So glorious in humility?

And death, that sets the prisoner free,
Was pang, and scoff, and scorn to Thee;
Yet love through all Thy torture glowed,
And mercy with Thy life-blood flowed.

O wondrous Lord, my soul would be
Still more and more conformed to Thee,
And learn of Thee, the lowly One,
And like Thee, all my journey run.--------89
What grace, O Lord, and beauty shone
Around Thy steps below!
What patient love was seen in all
Thy life and death of woe!

Forever on Thy burdened heart
A weight of sorrow hung,
Yet no ungentle, murm'ring word
Escaped Thy silent tongue.

Thy foes did hate, despise, revile,
Thy friends unfaithful prove;
Unwearied in forgiveness still
Thy heart could only love!--------90
Lord, accept our feeble song!
Pow'r and praise to Thee belong;
We would all Thy grace record,
Holy, gracious, loving Lord!

Rich in glory, Thou didst stoop,
Thence is all Thy people's hope;
Thou wast poor, that we might be
Rich in glory, Lord, with Thee.

Wherefore Thou high heaven didst spurn?
Wherefore Thou to earth didst turn?
Why leave heav'n to come to earth
Lonely, scorned, e'en suffering death?

Thou in heav'n  the glorious One!
Thou on earth  the outcast Man!
Though this suffering Thou didst know,
Love would come to bear our woe.

When we think of love like this,
Joy and shame our hearts possess;
Joy, that Thou couldst pity thus;
Shame, for such returns from us.

Yet we hope the day to see
When from every hindrance free,
When to Thee, in glory, brought,
We shall serve Thee as we ought.

Now, O Lord, we wait for Thee,
Wait "the blessed hope" to see.
May we ever for Thee live,
Till Thy saints Thou dost receive.--------91
It was alone the Savior prayed
In dark Gethsemane;
Alone He drained the bitter cup
And suffered there for me.

  Alone, alone,
  He bore it all alone;
  He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.

It was alone the Savior stood
In Pilate's judgment hall;
Alone the crown of thorns He wore,
Forsaken thus by all.

  Alone, alone,
  He bore it all alone;
  He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.

Alone upon the cross He hung
That others He might save;
Forsaken then by God and man.
Alone, His life He gave.

  Alone, alone,
  He bore it all alone;
  He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.

Can you reject such matchless love?
Can you His claim disown?
Come, give your all in gratitude,
Nor leave Him thus alone.

  Alone, alone,
  He bore it all alone;
  He gave Himself to save His own,
  He suffered, bled and died alone, alone.--------92
O dearest Lord, what law hast Thou e'er broken
That such sharp sentence should on Thee be spoken?
Of what misdeed hast Thou to make confession
What dark transgression?

They crown Thy head with thorns, they smite, they scourge Thee;
With cruel mockings to the cross they urge Thee;
They give Thee gall to drink, they still decry Thee;
They crucify Thee.

What punishment so strange is suffered yonder?
The shepherd dies for sheep that loved to wander;
The Master pays the debt His servants owe Him,
Who would not know Him.

The sinless Son of God must die in sadness;
The sinful child of man may live in gladness;
Man forfeited His life and is acquitted
God is committed.

O mighty King, no time can dim Thy glory!
How shall I spread abroad Thy wondrous story?
How shall I find some worthy gift to proffer?
What dare I offer?

I'll think upon Thy mercy without ceasing;
That earth's vain joys no more to me be pleasing;
To do Thy will shall be my sole endeavor
Henceforth forever.--------93
Lord, we treasure with affection
All Thy path of sorrow here,
And those closing scenes of anguish
To our hearts Thyself endear.

  Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
  Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
  Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
  Give Thee glory for the life we gain!

Deep Thy sorrow then, Lord Jesus,
Deeper far than thought can reach;
Grief intense and suff'rings holy,
Far beyond all tongues to teach.

  Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
  Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
  Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
  Give Thee glory for the life we gain!

None could follow there, blest Savior,
When redemption's work was done;
For those suff'rings, deep, unfathomed,
Were, Lord Jesus, Thine alone!

  Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
  Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
  Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
  Give Thee glory for the life we gain!

Thou didst measure then sin's distance,
Darkness, wrath and curse were Thine:
Man-betrayed, by God forsaken;
Thus we learn Thy love divine!

  Praise Thee, Savior! Praise Thee, Savior!
  Praise Thee, Lord, for sinners slain!
  Give Thee glory! Give Thee glory!
  Give Thee glory for the life we gain!--------94
O Christ, what burdens bow'd Thy head!
Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
Now there's no load for me.

Death and the curse were in our cup,
O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop
'Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup  love drank it up;
Now blessings' draught for me.

Jehovah lifted up His rod,
O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
There's not one stroke for me.
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
Thy bruising healeth me.

The tempest's awful voice was heard,
O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.

Jehovah bade His sword awake,
O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
Thy heart its sheath must be
All for my sake, my peace to make;
Now sleeps that sword for me.

For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died in Thee;
Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied,
And now Thou liv'st in me.
When purified, made white, and tried,
Thy glory then for me!--------95
O Head once full of bruises,
So full of pain and scorn,
Mid other sore abuses,
Mocked with a crown of thorn:
O Head e'en now surrounded
With brightest majesty,
In death once bowed and wounded
On the accursd tree:

Thou Countenance transcendent!
Thou life-creating Sun!
To worlds on Thee dependent
Yet bruised and spit upon:
O Lord, what Thee tormented
Was our sins' heavy load,
We had the debt augmented
Which Thou didst pay in blood.

We give Thee thanks unfeigned,
O Savior, Friend in need,
For what Thy soul sustained
When Thou for us didst bleed.
Grant us to lean unshaken
Upon Thy faithfulness,
Until, to glory taken,
We see Thee face to face.--------96
My song is love unknown,
My Savior's love to me;
Love to the loveless shown,
That they might lovely be.
O who am I,
That for my sake
My Lord should take
Frail flesh, and die?

He came from His blest throne
Salvation to bestow;
But men made strange, and none
The longed-for Christ would know:
But oh, my Friend,
My Friend indeed,
Who at my need
His life did spend.

Sometimes they strew His way,
And His sweet praises sing;
Resounding all the day
Hosannas to their King:
Then "Crucify!"
Is all their breath,
And for His death
They thirst and cry.

They rise and needs will have
My dear Lord made away;
A murderer they save '
The Prince of life they slay.
Yet cheerful He
To suffering goes,
That He His foes
From thence might free.

In life, no house, no home
My Lord on earth might have;
In death, no friendly tomb,
But what a stranger gave.
What may I say?
Heav'n was His home;
But mine the tomb
Wherein He lay.

Here might I stay and sing,
No story so divine;
Never was love, dear King,
Never was grief like Thine.
This is my Friend,
In whose sweet praise
I all my days
Could gladly spend.--------97
Thy sorrows, Savior, we retrace,
And tears of praise Thy griefs compel.
What love and grace illume Thy face
As Jesus, as Immanuel!

Amid Thy loneliness below,
What scorn and outrage Thee befell:
Deep shame and woe, rude blow on blow,
Endured for us, Immanuel!

But oh, what grief, what agony,
When wrathful judgment's awful spell
Burst over Thee on Calv'ry's tree,
God's Lamb for us, Immanuel!

Arisen radiant from the dead,
Thy sorrow's scars forever tell,
Creation's Head is He who bled
Still Jesus, still Immanuel!

E'en now from saints, in concord sweet,
Celestial strains of worship well;
For, O, 'tis meet glad songs should greet
Thy heart of love, Immanuel!

But when Thy glorious face we see,
How shall the bursting paean swell!
Our souls shall be outpoured for Thee
Outpoured for Thee, Immanuel!--------98
Jesus! Source of life eternal!
Jesus, Author of our breath!
Victor o'er the hosts infernal,
By defeat, and shame, and death,
Thou through deepest tribulation
Deigned to pass for our salvation:
Thousand, thousand praises be,
Lord of glory, unto Thee!

Thou, O Son of God! wert bearing
Cruel mockings, hatred, scorn;
Thou, the King of glory, wearing,
For our sake, the crown of thorn:
Dying, Thou didst us deliver
From the chains of sin for ever;
Thousand, thousand praises be,
Precious Savior, unto Thee!

All the shame men heaped upon Thee,
Thou didst patiently endure;
Not the pains of death too bitter,
Our redemption to procure:
Wondrous Thy humiliation
To accomplish our salvation:
Thousand, thousand praises be,
Precious Savior, unto Thee!

Heart-felt praise and adoration,
Savior, thus to Thee we give:
For Thy life's humiliation,
For Thy death, whereby we live;
All the grief Thou wert enduring,
All the bliss Thou wert securing,
Evermore the theme shall be,
Of thanksgivings, Lord, to Thee.--------99
'Tis midnight, and on Olive's brow
The star is dimmed that lately shone;
'Tis midnight in the garden now,
The suff'ring Savior prays alone.

'Tis midnight, and from all removed,
The Savior wrestles lone with fears
E'en that disciple whom He loved
Heeds not his Master's grief and tears.

'Tis midnight, and for other's guilt
The Man of Sorrows weeps in blood;
Yet He that hath in anguish knelt
Is not forsaken by His God.

'Tis midnight, and from ether-plains
Is borne the song that angels know
Unheard by mortals are the strains
That sweetly soothe the Savior's woe.--------100
The Maker of the universe
As Man, for man was made a curse.
The claims of law which He had made,
Unto the uttermost He paid.

His holy fingers made the bough
Which grew the thorns that, crowned His brow.
The nails that pierced His hands were mined
In secret places He designed.

He made the forest whence there sprung
The tree on which His body hung.
He died upon a cross of wood,
Yet made the hill on which it stood.

The sky that darkened o'er His head
By Him above the earth was spread.
The sun that hid from Him its face
By His decree was poised in space.

The spear which spilled His precious blood
Was tempered in the fires of God.
The grave in which His form was laid,
Was hewn in rocks His hands had made.

The throne on which He now appears
Was His from everlasting years,
But a new glory crowns His brow,
And every knee to Him shall bow.--------101
When we survey the wondrous cross
On which the Lord of glory died,
Our richest gain we count but loss,
And pour contempt on all our pride.

Our God forbid that we should boast,
Save in the death of Christ, our Lord;
All the vain things that charm us most,
We'd sacrifice them to His blood.

There from His head, His hands, His feet,
Sorrow and love flowed mingled down;
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,
Or thorns compose so rich a crown?

His dying crimson, from His head
Spreads o'er His body on the tree;
To all the world then am I dead,
And all the world is dead to me.

Were the whole realm of nature ours,
That were an offering far too small;
Love that transcends our highest pow'rs,
Demands our heart, our life, our all.--------102
We sing the praise of Him who died,
Of Him who died upon the Cross;
The sinner's hope let men deride,
For this we count the world but loss.

Inscribed upon the Cross we see
In shining letters, God is love!
He bears our sins upon the tree,
He brings us mercy from above.

The Cross: it takes our guilt away;
It holds the fainting spirit up;
It cheers with hope the gloomy day,
And sweetens every bitter cup.

The balm of life, the cure of woe,
The measure and the pledge of love,
The sinner's refuge here below,
The angels' theme in heav'n above.--------103
Behold! Behold the Lamb of God,
On the cross! On the cross!
For us He shed His precious blood,
On the cross! On the cross!
O hear His all-important cry,
"Eli, lama sabachthani?"
Draw near and see the Savior die,
On the cross! On the cross!

Behold His arms extended wide,
On the cross! On the cross!
Behold His bleeding hands and side,
On the cross! On the cross!
The sun withholds its rays of light,
The heav'ns are clothed in shades of night,
While Jesus wins the glorious fight,
On the cross! On the cross!

By faith we see Him lifted up,
On the cross! On the cross!
He drinks for us the bitter cup,
On the cross! On the cross!
The rocks do rend, the mountains quake,
While Jesus all our sins doth take,
While Jesus suffers for our sake,
On the cross! On the cross!

And now the mighty deed is done,
On the cross! On the cross!
The battle fought, the vict'ry won,
On the cross! On the cross!
To heav'n He turns triumphant eyes;
" 'Tis finished" now, the Conqu'ror cries,
Then bows His sacred head and dies,
On the cross! On the cross!

But now He's ris'n, ascended, crowned,
On the throne! On the throne!
Heav'n's highest place for Him is found,
On the throne! On the throne!
Our hearts we low in worship bow,
And join, as one, to hail Him now:
"Worthy, O Lamb of God, art Thou!"
On the throne! On the throne!--------104
Alas! And did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sov'reign die,
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut his glories in,
When the incarnate Maker died
For man, His creature's sin.

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away:
'Tis all that I can do.--------105
Himself He could not save,
He on the cross must die,
Or mercy could not come
To ruined sinners nigh;
Yes Christ, the Son of God, must bleed,
That sinners might from sin be freed.

Himself He could not save,
For justice must be done;
Our sins' full weight must fall
Upon the sinless One;
For nothing less can God accept
In payment of that fearful debt.

Himself He could not save,
For He the Surety stood
For all who now rely
Upon His precious blood;
He bore the penalty of guilt
When on the cross His blood was spilt.

Himself He could not save,
What wondrous love is this!
In love Himself He gave,
There ne'er was love like His!
Such love should melt a heart of stone,
Till praise flows forth to Him alone!--------106
No blood, no altar now,
The sacrifice is o'er!
No flame, no smoke ascends on high,
The lamb is slain no more,
But richer blood has flowed from nobler veins,
To purge the soul from guilt, and cleanse the reddest stains.

We thank Thee for the blood,
The blood of Christ, God's Son:
The blood by which our peace is made,
Redemption great is won,
Delivering us from hell, and sin, and woe;
That His eternal life God may to us bestow.--------107
Not all the blood of beasts,
On Jewish altars slain,
Could give the guilty conscience peace,
Or wash away its stain.

But Christ, the heavenly Lamb,
Takes all our sins away;
A sacrifice of nobler name,
And richer blood than they.

My faith would lay her hand
On that dear head of Thine,
While like a penitent I stand,
And there confess my sin.

My soul looks back to see
The burdens Thou didst bear
When hanging on the cursd tree,
And knows her guilt was there.

Believing, we rejoice
To see the curse remove;
We bless the Lamb with cheerful voice,
And sing His bleeding love.--------108
"Man of Sorrows," what a name
For the Son of God who came
Ruined sinners to reclaim!
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Bearing shame and scoffing rude,
In my place condemned He stood;
Sealed my pardon with His blood;
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Guilty, vile, and helpless, we,
Spotless Lamb of God was He;
Full redemption  can it be?
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

Lifted up was He to die,
"It is finished!" was His cry;
Now in heaven exalted high;
Hallelujah! What a Savior!

When He comes, our glorious King,
To His kingdom us to bring,
Then anew this song we'll sing:
Hallelujah! What a Savior!--------109
The veil is rent! Lo! Jesus stands
Before the throne of grace;
And clouds of incense from His hands
Fill all that glorious place.

His precious blood is sprinkled there,
Before and on the throne;
And His own wounds in heav'n declare
His work on earth is done.

" 'Tis finished!" on the cross He said,
'In agonies and blood;
'Tis finished: now He lives to plead
Before the face of God.

" 'Tis finished!" Here our souls can rest,
His work can never fail;
By Him, our Sacrifice and Priest,
We enter through the veil.--------110
O solemn hour! O hour alone,
In solitary night,
When God the Father's only Son,
As Man, for sinners lost, undone,
Expires  amazing sight!
The Lord of glory crucified!
The Lord of Life has bled and died!

O mystery of mysteries!
Of life and death the tree!
Center of two eternities,
Which look with rapt, adoring eyes,
Onward, and back to Thee!
O cross of Christ, where all His pain
And death is our eternal gain.

O how our inmost hearts do move,
While gazing on that cross!
The death of the incarnate Love!
What shame, what grief, what joy we prove,
That He should die for us!
Our hearts were broken by that cry,
"Eli, lama sabachthani!"

Worthy of death, O Lord, we were;
That vengeance was our due;
In grace Thou, spotless Lamb, didst bear
Thyself our sins, and guilt, and fear;
Justice our Surety slew.
With Thee, our Surety, we have died;
With Thee, we there were crucified.

Quickened with Thee with life divine,
Raised with Thee from the dead;
Thine Own, now human and divine,
Shall with Thee in Thy glories shine,
The Church's living Head!
We, who were worthy but to die,
Now with Thee, "Abba Father," cry.--------111
Jesus, the sinner's Friend,
We hide ourselves in Thee;
God looks upon Thy sprinkled blood,
It is our only plea.

He hears Thy precious Name,
We claim it as our own;
The Father must accept and bless
His well-beloved Son.

Thou hast fulfilled the law,
And we are justified:
Ours is the blessing, Thine the curse;
We live, for Thou hast died.

Jesus, the sinner's Friend!
We cannot speak Thy praise;
No mortal voice can sing the song
That ransomed hearts would raise.

But when before the throne,
Thy face we all shall see,
Clothed in our blood-bought robes of white,
We'll stand complete in Thee.

Jesus, we'll give Thee then
Such praises as are meet,
And give ten thousand thanks to Thee,
Adoring, at Thy feet.--------112
How sweet is the story of Christ's boundless love,
That brought Him to suffer from glory above!
He died in our stead upon Calvary's tree,
Obtaining redemption that we might be free.

  Sound His praise! Sound His praise!
  All the work has been done;
  Praise His name! Praise His name!
  Jesus, God's blessed Son.
  We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
  Our song is of Jesus and never will end.

How wondrous the story! the law's holy claims
Were met by the blood which redemption proclaims.
The judgment of sin has been borne by the Son,
Who glorified God in the work He has done.

  Sound His praise! Sound His praise!
  All the work has been done;
  Praise His name! Praise His name!
  Jesus, God's blessed Son.
  We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
  Our song is of Jesus and never will end.

How brilliant the glory where Christ is enthroned
How rightly His name above others is owned!
Yes, Jesus, the Savior, the glory-crowned Lord,
Is worthy by all to be ever adored.

  Sound His praise! Sound His praise!
  All the work has been done;
  Praise His name! Praise His name!
  Jesus, God's blessed Son.
  We give Him the glory, our Savior and Friend;
  Our song is of Jesus and never will end.--------113
How pleasant is the sound of praise!
It well becomes the saints of God;
Should we refuse our songs to raise,
The stones might tell our shame abroad.

For Him Who washed us in His blood,
Let us our sweetest songs prepare;
He sought us wandering far from God,
And now preserves us by His care.

One string there is of sweetest tone,
Reserved for sinners saved by grace;
'Tis sacred to one class alone
And touched by one peculiar race.

Though angels may with rapture see
How mercy flows in Jesus' blood,
It is not theirs to prove, as we,
The cleansing virtue of this flood.

Though angels praise the heavenly King,
And worship Him as God alone,
We can with exultation sing,
"He wears our nature on the throne."

Lord, we adore Thy wondrous love,
Which brought Thee here to bleed and die
That Thou lost sinners may restore
And to the Father bring them nigh.--------114
Hail, Thou once despisd Jesus!
Hail, Thou still rejected King!
Thou didst suffer to release us,
Thou didst free salvation bring;
Through Thy death and resurrection,
Bearer of our sin and shame!
We enjoy divine protection,
Life and glory through Thy name.

Paschal Lamb, by God appointed,
All our sins on Thee were laid;
By our Father's love anointed,
Thou redemption's price hast paid.
All who trust Thee are forgiven
Through the virtue of Thy blood;
Opened are the things of heaven,
Grace shines forth to man from God.

Savior, hail! Enthroned in glory,
Where for us Thou dost abide;
We, by faith, do now adore Thee,
Seated at Thy Father's side.
There, for us Thou now art pleading,
There Thou dost our sorrows share,
Ever for us interceding,
Till in glory we appear.

Worship, honor, praise, and blessing,
Thou art worthy to receive;
Loudest praises, without ceasing,
Meet it is for us to give.
In that day Thy saints will meet Thee,
Welcome Thee with grateful song;
Joyful hearts will ever greet Thee,
Source of joy to all the throng!--------115
Glory be to Jesus,
Who in bitter pains
Poured for me the life-blood
From His sacred veins.

Grace and life eternal
In that Blood I find;
Blest be His compassion,
Infinitely kind.

Blest through endless ages
Be the precious stream,
Which from endless torments
Did the world redeem.

Abel's blood for vengeance
Pleaded to the skies;
But the blood of Jesus
For our pardon cries.

It the conscience sprinkles,
Frees our guilty hearts;
Satan in confusion
Terror-struck departs.

Oft as earth exulting
Wafts its praise on high,
Angel-hosts rejoicing
Make their glad reply.

Lift ye then your voices;
Swell the mighty flood;
Louder still and louder
Praise the precious blood.--------116
How wonderful redemption is,
My gracious Lord, in Thee!
Not seen, nor heard, nor e'er conceived
What Thou hast done for me!
Thou art divine, mysterious,
Beyond my grandest phrase!
Redemption is so marvellous,
Beyond all pow'r to praise!

(Chorus in Chinese Hymnal Only)
How wondrous redemption is,
New creation glorious.
Effective through eternal 'tis
All worthy of our praise.

For us Thou on the Cross wast pierced,
And blood and water streamed;
That life divine be giv'n to us,
That we may be redeemed.
Thy precious blood has made us clean,
That we accepted be;
Regenerated by Thy life,
We now are one with Thee.

(Chorus in Chinese Hymnal Only)
How wondrous redemption is,
New creation glorious.
Effective through eternal 'tis
All worthy of our praise.

Thou art the grain divine that died
The many grains to bear,
Which, blent and formed, Thy Body are,
And all Thy nature share.
We are the increase of Thyself,
And Thou our content art;
Through us Thou livest and dost move
And manifested art.

(Chorus in Chinese Hymnal Only)
How wondrous redemption is,
New creation glorious.
Effective through eternal 'tis
All worthy of our praise.

Since we're Thy Body, Thou may come
And settle down in us;
In us Thou may obtain Thy home
And we become Thy trust.
Thy heart to satisfy and please,
We are Thy counterpart,
Now in one Body with Thyself,
Enjoying all Thou art.

(Chorus in Chinese Hymnal Only)
How wondrous redemption is,
New creation glorious.
Effective through eternal 'tis
All worthy of our praise.

While in remembrance now we meet
And here the symbols see,
For Thy redemption great and full
We're filled with praise to Thee.
Since we are made Thy Body, Lord,
Thy dwelling place and bride,
We would give thanks and worship Thee
And in Thy praise abide.

(Chorus in Chinese Hymnal Only)
How wondrous redemption is,
New creation glorious.
Effective through eternal 'tis
All worthy of our praise.--------117
Christ the Lord is ris'n indeed,
Hallelujah!
He has met His people's need,
Hallelujah!
Raise your joys and triumphs high,
Hallelujah!
Sing, ye heav'ns and earth, reply,
Hallelujah!

Lives again our glorious King,
Hallelujah!
Where, O Death, is now thy sting?
Hallelujah!
Dying once He all doth save,
Hallelujah!
Where thy victory, O grave?
Hallelujah!

Love's redeeming work is done,
Hallelujah!
Fought the fight, the battle won,
Hallelujah!
Death in vain forbade Him rise,
Hallelujah!
Christ ascended o'er the skies,
Hallelujah!

Soar we now where Christ hath led,
Hallelujah!
Following our exalted Head,
Hallelujah!
Made like Him, like Him we rise,
Hallelujah!
Free from all the earthly ties,
Hallelujah!--------118
Christ is risen! Hallelujah!
Risen our victorious Head;
Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
Christ is risen from the dead.
Gratefully our hearts adore Him,
As His light once more appears;
Bowing down in joy before Him,
Rising up from griefs and tears.

  Christ is risen: Hallelujah!
  Risen our victorious Head;
  Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
  Christ is risen from the dead.

Christ is risen! All the sadness
Of His earthly life is o'er;
Through the open gates of gladness
He returns to life once more;
Death and hell before Him bending,
He doth rise the Victor now,
Angels on His steps attending,
Glory round His wounded brow.

  Christ is risen: Hallelujah!
  Risen our victorious Head;
  Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
  Christ is risen from the dead.

Christ is risen! Henceforth never
Death nor hell shall us enthrall;
We are Christ's, in Him forever
We have triumphed over all;
All the doubting and dejection
Of our trembling hearts have ceased,
'Tis His day of resurrection;
Let us rise and keep the feast.

  Christ is risen: Hallelujah!
  Risen our victorious Head;
  Sing His praises; Hallelujah!
  Christ is risen from the dead.--------119
Hallelujah, "He is risen!"
Jesus is gone up on high!
Burst the bars of death asunder;
Angels shout, and men reply:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living now, no more to die.

Hallelujah, He is risen!
Our exalted Head to be;
Sends the witness of the Spirit
That our Advocate is He:
He is risen, He is risen,
Justified in Him are we.

Hallelujah, He is risen!
Death for aye has lost his sting;
Christ, Himself the Resurrection,
From the grave "His own" will bring:
He is risen, He is risen,
Living Lord and coming King--------120
The Lord is ris'n; and death's dark judgment flood
Is passed, in Him who bought us with His blood.
The Lord is ris'n: we stand beyond the doom
Of all our sin, through Jesus' empty tomb.

The Lord is ris'n: with Him we also rose,
And in His grave see vanquished all our foes.
The Lord is ris'n: beyond the judgment land,
In Him, in resurrection-life we stand.

The Lord is ris'n: and now redeemed to God,
We tread the desert which His feet have trod.
The Lord is ris'n: the sanctu'ry's our place,
Where now we dwell before the Father's face.

The Lord is ris'n: the Lord is gone before.
We long to see Him, and to sin no more.
The Lord is ris'n: our triumph-shout shall be,
"Thou hast prevailed! Thy people, Lord, are free!"--------121
Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won
Angels in bright raiment rolled the stone away,
Kept the folded grave-clothes, where Thy body lay.

  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
  Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won.

Lo! Jesus meets us, risen from the tomb;
Lovingly He greets us, scatters fear and gloom;
Let the Church with gladness, hymns of triumph sing,
For her Lord now liveth, death hath lost its sting.

  Thine be the glory, risen, conqu'ring Son,
  Endless is the vict'ry Thou o'er death hast won.--------122
Thou, Lord, to death's domain
Didst go alone.
Death had on Thee no claim,
Thou sinless One!
He who had death's dread pow'r
Met Thee in that dark hour:
Vanquished by Thee his power,
By Thee alone.

But Thou hast burst the grave,
Risen art Thou;
Death could not Thee enslave,
Death had to bow!
Victorious hast Thou come
Out of the darksome tomb,
Broken the bands of gloom:
Beyond death now.

What mighty triumphs, Lord,
Thou didst achieve!
What fruitfulness doth God
From Thee receive!
Out of Thy death has sprung
A wondrous living throng:
All, all to Thee belong,
And in Thee live.

Firstborn of all Thou art,
Lowly we bow;
Chief in Thy Father's heart
Chief to us now.
Thou art indeed supreme,
Our great eternal theme,
Worthy of all esteem:
Worthy art Thou!--------123
Low in the grave He lay
Jesus my Savior!
Waiting the coming day
Jesus my Lord!

  Up from the grave He arose,
  With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
  He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
  And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
  He arose! He arose!
  Hallelujah! Christ arose!

Vainly they watch His bed
Jesus, my Savior!
Vainly they seal the dead
Jesus, my Lord!

  Up from the grave He arose,
  With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
  He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
  And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
  He arose! He arose!
  Hallelujah! Christ arose!

Death cannot keep his prey
Jesus, my Savior!
He tore the bars away
Jesus, my Lord!

  Up from the grave He arose,
  With a mighty triumph o'er His foes;
  He arose a Victor from the dark domain,
  And He lives forever with His saints to reign.
  He arose! He arose!
  Hallelujah! Christ arose!--------124
Praise Him! Praise Him! Christ is Victor!
He has won the victory!
Sin is judged, old Adam finished,
Full redemption now we see!
Vanquished all the evil powers
Thru the Cross triumphantly!

Praise Him! Christ is resurrected!
God hath raised Him from the dead!
All the pow'r of death is swallowed,
Man from death to life is led!
Broken through are hell and darkness
And His pow'r exhibited!

Praise Him! Christ hath now ascended!
God hath raised Him to the throne!
Far above all rule and power,
He the highest Name doth own!
All authority receiving
Till His foe is overthrown!

Hallelujah, Christ the Victor
Triumphed on Mt. Calvary!
Hallelujah, resurrected,
He displays His victory!
Hallelujah, now ascended,
He shall reign eternally!--------125
Hallelujah! Sing to Jesus,
His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation
Hath redeemed us by His blood.

Hallelujah! Not as orphans
Are we left in sorrow now;
Hallelujah! He is near us,
Faith believes, nor questions how.
Though the clouds from sight received Him
When the forty days were o'er,
Shall our hearts forget His promise,
"I am with you evermore"?

Hallelujah! Bread of heaven,
Thou on earth our food, our stay;
Hallelujah! Here the hungry
Come to Thee from day to day.
Advocate and Intercessor,
My Redeemer pleads for me,
On the throne of the Almighty
Now and to eternity.

Hallelujah! Sing to Jesus,
His the scepter, His the throne;
Hallelujah! His the triumph,
His the victory alone.
Hark, the songs of His redeemed ones
Thunder like a mighty flood:
Jesus out of every nation,
Hath redeemed us by His blood.--------126
To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
For Thou hast shed Thy precious blood
Our cup of joy to bring.
Thy mighty arm the fight hath fought,
Thou art enthroned above;
We into glory will be brought
Thy wondrous grace to prove.

To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
Thou hast invaded death's abode
And robbed him of his sting.
The house of dust enthralls no more,
For Thou, the strong to save,
Thyself doth guard that silent door,
Great Keeper of the grave.

To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
For Thou hast crushed beneath Thy rod
The world's proud rebel king,
And plunged in Thine imperial strength
To gulfs of darkness down,
And brought Thy trophy up at length,
The foiled usurper's crown.

To Thee, dear Lord, O Christ of God,
We sing, we ever sing;
Thou hast redeemed us with Thy blood
From every evil thing.
God's saving strength Thine arm upbore,
The arm that set us free;
Glory, O Christ, for evermore
Be to Thy God and Thee.--------127
Hark! Ten thousand voices crying,
"Lamb of God!" with one accord;
Thousand thousand saints replying,
Wake at once the echo'ng chord.

"Praise the Lamb!" the chorus waking,
All in heav'n together throng;
Loud and far each tongue partaking
Rolls around the endless song.

Grateful incense this, ascending
Ever to the Father's throne;
Every knee to Jesus bending,
All the mind in heav'n is one.

All the Father's counsels claiming
Equal honors to the Son,
All the Son's effulgence beaming,
Makes the Father's glory known.

By the Spirit all pervading,
Hosts unnumbered round the Lamb,
Crowned with light and joy unfading,
Hail Him as the great "I AM."

Joyful now the new creation
Rests in undisturbed repose,
Blest in Jesus' full salvation,
Sorrow now nor thraldom knows.

Hark! The heavenly notes again!
Loudly swells the song of praise;
Through creation's vault, Amen!
Amen! Responsive joy doth raise.--------128
Far above all is our Savior enthroned;
Crown'd is the Lamb who by sinners is owned,
Living forever to list to our call,
God hath exalted Him far above all.

  Far above all! Far above all!
  Jesus the crucified far above all!
  High as His members upon Him we call,
  God hath exalted Him far above all!

When the fierce tempest, uplifting its waves,
Seeks to engulf us, we cry and He saves;
Looking to Jesus, upheld by His hand,
Tread we the billows as safe as on land.

  Far above all! Far above all!
  Jesus the crucified far above all!
  High as His members upon Him we call,
  God hath exalted Him far above all!

High are the cities that dare our assault,
Strong are the barriers that call us to halt;
March we on fearless, and down they must fall,
Vanquish'd by faith in Him far above all.

  Far above all! Far above all!
  Jesus the crucified far above all!
  High as His members upon Him we call,
  God hath exalted Him far above all!

His is the kingdom from pole unto pole,
Far above all while the ages shall roll,
With Him the victors, who follow'd His call,
Share in His royalty far above all.

  Far above all! Far above all!
  Jesus the crucified far above all!
  High as His members upon Him we call,
  God hath exalted Him far above all!--------129
Behold the Lamb with glory crowned,
To Him all pow'r is giv'n:
No place too high for Him is found,
No place too high in heav'n.

He fills the throne  the throne above;
Its rights to Him belong;
The object of His Father's love,
Theme of the ransomed's song.

Though high yet He accepts the praise
His people offer here;
The faintest, feeblest note they raise
Will reach the Savior's ear.

This song be ours, we join in one
To celebrate the Name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to exalt the Lamb.

To Him whom men despise and slight,
To Him be glory giv'n;
The crown is His, and His by right
The highest place in heav'n.--------130
See the Conqu'ror mount in triumph,
See the King in royal state
Riding on the clouds His chariot
To His;heav'nly palace gate;
Hark! The choirs of angel voices
Joyful hallelujahs sing,
And the portals high are lifted
To receive, to receive, to receive their
heav'nly King.

Who is this that comes in glory,
With the trump of jubilee?
Lord of battles, God of armies,
He has gained the victory;
He who on the cross did suffer,
He who from the grave arose,
He has vanquished sin and Satan,
He by death, He by death, He by
death has spoiled His foes.

While He lifts His hands in blessing
He is parted from His friends;
While their eager eyes behold Him,
He upon the clouds ascends;
He who walked with God and pleased Him,
Preaching truth and doom to come,
He, our Enoch, is translated
To His home, to His home, to His everlasting
home.

Now our heavenly Aaron enters,
With His blood, within the veil;
Joshua now is come to Canaan,
And the kings before Him quail;
Now He plants the tribes of Israel
In their promised resting-place;
Now our great Elijah offers
Of His grace, of His grace,
double portion of His grace.

He has raised our human nature
On the clouds to God's right hand;
There we sit in heav'nly places,
There with Him in glory stand. Jesus reigns,
adored by angels;
Man with God is on the throne;
Mighty Lord, in Thine ascension
We by faith, we by faith, we by
faith behold our own.--------131
O Jesus, Lord, 'tis joy to know
Thy path is o'er of shame and woe,
By Thee so meekly trod.
All finished is Thy work of toil,
Thou reapest now the fruit and spoil,
Exalted by our God.

Thy holy head, once bound with thorns,
The crown of glory now adorns;
Thy seat, the Father's throne.
O Lord, e'en now we sing Thy praise,
Ours the eternal song to raise,
Worthy the Lord alone!

We triumph in Thy triumphs, Lord,
Thy joys our deepest joys afford,
The fruit of love divine.
While sorrowing, suff'ring, toiling here,
How does the thought our spirits cheer,
The throne of glory's Thine!--------132
Lo! In heaven Jesus sitting,
Christ the Lord is there enthroned;
As the man by God exalted,
With God's glory He is crowned.

He hath put on human nature,
Died according to God's plan,
Resurrected with a body,
And ascended as a man.

God in Him on earth was humbled,
God with man was domiciled;
Man in Him in heav'n exalted,
Man with God is reconciled.

He as God with man is mingled,
God in man is testified;
He as man with God is blended,
Man in God is glorified.

From the Glorified in heaven
The inclusive Spirit came;
All of Jesus' work and Person
Doth this Spirit here proclaim.

With the Glorified in heaven
Is the Church identified;
By the Spirit of this Jesus
Are His members edified.

Lo! A man is now in heaven
As the Lord of all enthroned;
This is Jesus Christ our Savior,
With God's glory ever crowned!--------133
Lord Jesus, Thou art Lord of all,
With glory ever crowned;
In power and in majesty
Thou art to all renowned.

As God in man, on earth Thou wast,
A slave-form Thou didst own;
As man in God, in heav'n Thou art,
As Lord of all art known.

Thou art the Man in glory there,
And there by God enthroned;
All pow'r in heaven and on earth
Now by Thyself is owned.

Exalted highly to the heav'ns
And giv'n the highest Name,
All shall confess Thee as the Lord
And all bow at Thy Name.

God made Thee both the Lord and Christ,
The Spirit hath declared;
In glory and in heav'n we see
God's throne by Thee is shared.

As Lord of glory we adore,
To Thee our song we raise;
We worship Thee as Lord of all,
How worthy of our praise!--------134
Glory, everlasting glory
Be to Christ, the thrond Lamb.
Glory, everlasting glory
Be to His most precious Name;
Name above all names in heaven,
Name above all names on earth.
Glory, everlasting glory
Be to Him of peerless worth.

Throned in heav'n, the Prince of Glory,
Equal God, with God on high;
Form of lowest servant taking,
On the cross of shame to die:
In obedience, strong, unswerving,
His blest Father's will to do;
Death of shame, all undeservd,
E'en to that His love could go.

Heaven's crown of brightest glory
Be to Him, the humbled One.
Heaven's robe of brightest splendor
Be to Him and Him alone.
In the Name of Jesus bowing,
Every tongue shall Him confess
Lord of earth and Lord of heaven;
Myriads shall this Monarch bless.

Glory, everlasting glory
Be to Him of peerless worth.
In the highest heav'n be glory,
Glory be to Him on earth.
Unto God, our God, be glory,
Glory to the great I AM.
Glory, everlasting glory
Be to Christ, the thrond Lamb.--------135
O my Savior, glorified!
Now the heavens, opened wide,
Show to faith's exultant eye
One in beauteous majesty.

Worthy of the sweetest praise
That my ransomed heart can raise,
Is that Man in whom alone
God Himself is fully known.

For those clustering glories prove
That glad gospel, "God is Love"
Whilst those wounds, in glory bright,
Voice the solemn, "God is Light."

Hark, my soul! Thy Savior sings;
Catch the joy that music brings,
And, with that sweet flood of song,
Pour thy whisp'ring praise along.

O my Savior, glorified,
Turn my eye from all beside,
Let me but Thy beauty see,
Other light is dark to me.--------136
Gazing on the Lord in glory,
While our hearts in worship bow,
There we read the wondrous story
Of the cross  its shame and woe.

Every mark of dark dishonor
Heaped upon the thorn-crowned brow,
All the depths of Thy heart's sorrow
Told in answ'ring glory now.

On that cross, alone, forsaken,
Where no pity'ng eve was found;
Now, to God's right hand exalted,
With Thy praise the heavens resound.

Did Thy God e'en then forsake Thee,
Hide His face from Thy deep need?
In Thy face once marred and smitten,
All His glory now we read.

Gazing on it we adore Thee,
Blessed, precious, holy Lord;
Thou, the Lamb, alone art worthy
This be earth's and heaven's accord.

Rise our hearts, and bless the Father,
Ceaseless song e'en here begun,
Endless praise and adoration
To the Father and the Son.--------137

Look, ye saints, the sight is glorious;
See the Man of sorrows now;
From the fight returned victorious,
Every knee to Him shall bow;
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crowns become the Victor's brow.

Crown the Savior! Angels, crown Him!
Rich the trophies Jesus brings;
In the seat of pow'r enthrone Him,
While the vault of heaven rings:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown the Savior King of kings.

Sinners in derision crowned Him,
Mocking thus the Savior's claim;
Saints and angels crowd around Him,
Own His title, praise His name:
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Spread abroad the Victor's fame.

Hark! Those bursts of acclamation!
Hark! Those loud triumphant chords!
Jesus takes the highest station;
O what joy the sight affords!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
Crown Him! Crown Him!
King of kings, and Lord of lords!--------141
Jesus, Thy head, once crown'd with thorns,
Is crown'd with glory now;
Heaven's royal diadem adorns
The mighty Victor's brow.

Thou glorious light of courts above,
Joy of the saints below,
To us still manifest Thy love,
That we its depths may know.

To us Thy cross with all its shame,
With all its grace be giv'n;
Though earth disowns Thy lowly name,
God honors it in heav'n.

Who suffer with Thee, Lord, today,
Shall also with Thee reign:
Then let it be our joy to pay
The price, this goal attain.

To us Thy cross is life and health;
'Twas shame and death to Thee;
Our present glory, joy and wealth,
Our everlasting stay.--------142
Crown Him with many crowns,
The Lamb upon His throne;
Hark! How the heav'nly anthem drowns
All music but its own!
Awake, my soul, and sing
Of Him who died for thee,
And hail Him as thy matchless King
Through all eternity.

Crown Him the Virgin's Son,
The God Incarnate born,
Whose arm those crimson trophies won
Which now His brow adorn:
Fruit of the mystic Tree,
As of that Tree the Stem;
The Root whence flows Thy mercy free,
The Babe of Bethlehem.

Crown Him the Lord of Love:
Behold His hands and side;
Rich wounds yet visible above
In beauty glorified:
No angel in the sky
Can fully bear that sight,
But downward bends his burning eye
At mysteries so bright.

Crown Him the Lord of peace,
Whose power a scepter sways
From pole to pole, that wars may cease,
And all be prayer and praise.
His reign shall know no end,
And round His piercd feet
Fair flowers of glory now extend
Their fragrance ever sweet.

Crown Him the Lord of years,
The Potentate of time,
Creator of the rolling spheres,
Ineffably sublime.
All hail, Redeemer, hail!
For Thou hast died for me;
Thy praise shall never, never fail
Throughout eternity.--------143
On His Father's throne is seated
Christ the Lord, the living One!
All His toil on earth completed,
All His work for sinners done.

See Him  God's eternal Son!

Every knee shall bow before Him,
Every tongue confess His name,
Ransomed myriads shall adore Him,
Who endured the sinner's shame!
From the glory, from the glory,
God doth now His worth proclaim.

Man, the cross to Him awarded;
Man, the Savior crucified;
This world's judgment stands recorded,
God's own justice satisfied!
By the glory, by the glory,
Christ was claimed on earth who died.

Son of Man, His incarnation
Opened first the tale of grace;
Son of Man, in new creation
Leader of a chosen race!
Well may glory, well may glory,
Give to Him the honored place!--------144
Lord of glory, we adore Thee!
Christ of God, ascended high!
Heart and soul we bow before Thee,
Glorious now beyond the sky:
Thee we worship, Thee we praise
Excellent in all Thy ways.

Anointed King, with glory crownd,
Rightful Heir and Lord of all!
Once rejected, scorned, disownd,
E'en by those Thou cam'st to call:
Thee we honor, Thee adore
Glorious now and evermore.

Lord of life! To death once subject;
Blesser, yet a curse once made;
Of Thy Father's heart the object,
Yet in depths of anguish laid;
Thee we gaze on, Thee recall
Bearing here our sorrows all.

Royal robes shall soon invest Thee,
Royal splendors crown Thy brow;
Christ of God, our souls confess Thee
King and Sov'reign even now!
Thee we rev'rence, Thee obey
Own Thee Lord and Christ alway.--------145
Jesus shall reign where'er the sun
Doth his successive journeys run;
His Kingdom stretch from shore to shore,
Till moons shall wax and wane no more.

To Him shall endless prayer be made,
And princes throng to crown His head,
His name like sweet perfume shall rise
With every morning sacrifice.

People and realms of every tongue
Dwell on His love with sweetest song;
And infant voices shall proclaim
Their early blessings on His name.

Blessings abound where'er He reigns:
The prisoner leaps to lose his chains,
The weary find eternal rest,
And all the sons of want are blest.

Where He displays His healing power
Death and the curse are known no more;
In Him the tribes of Adam boast
More blessings than their father lost.

Let every creature rise and bring
Peculiar honors to our King;
Angels descend with songs again,
And earth repeat the loud Amen.--------146
Rejoice, the Lord is King,
Your Lord and King adore;
Mortals, give thanks and sing,
And triumph evermore:

  Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
  Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

His kingdom cannot fail;
He rules o'er earth and heav'n;
The keys of death and hell
Are to our Jesus giv'n:

  Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
  Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

Jesus, the Savior reigns,
The God of truth and love:
When He had purged our stains,
He took His seat above:

  Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
  Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.

He sits, at God's right hand
Till all His foes submit,
And bow to His command,
And fall beneath His feet:

  Lift up your heart, lift up your voice;
  Rejoice, again I say, rejoice.--------147
Lord, Thou art God's anointed,
Thou art of kings the King!
Here in full adoration
Our song to Thee we bring!
Thy kingdom is forever,
Established is Thy throne!
Thy reign with love and justice
In glory stands alone!

Upon the hill of Zion
Hath God established Thee
And all the nations given
Thy heritage to be.
To Thee hath God committed
His full authority
To rule with might the nations
Unto eternity.

Before the time of fulness,
While darkness still prevails,
Ten thousands daily render
To Thee their loyal hails!
From shore to shore Thy people
To Thee their praises sing;
They worship, love, and serve Thee
As their dear Savior-King!

When in the time appointed
With glory Thou wilt come,
The earth with all its nations
Thy kingdom will become.
In majesty and splendor
Wilt Thou be served as King,
All kindreds and all peoples
To Thee their praise shall ring!--------148
Lord, the King of kings art Thou,
In Thy presence here we bow;
God's anointed we adore,
Worship Thee in holy awe.
Unto Thee, of kings the King,
All the saints Thy praises sing!

Thine authority and pow'r
Shall prevail from shore to shore!
All shall serve and worship
Thee In Thy kingly majesty!
Unto Thee, of kings the King,
All Thy praise shall ever ring!

Lord, Thy kingdom stands alone,
And forever is Thy throne!
To Thy glory and Thy pow'r
We will sing forevermore!
Now to Thee, of kings the King,
All the saints Thy praises sing!

Gracious Lord, our sovereign King,
Thy dear name we love to sing!
O how sweet Thy reign and rule,
May Thy kingdom come in full!
Yet to Thee, of kings the King,
Here Thy praise we gladly sing!--------149
Hark! Ten thousand heav'nly voices
Sound the note of praise above;
Jesus reigns and heav'n rejoices,
Jesus reigns, the God of love.
See, He sits on yonder throne;
Jesus rules the world alone.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

Sing how Jesus came from heaven,
How He bore the cross below,
How all power to Him is given,
How He reigns in glory now.
'Tis a great and endless theme
Oh, 'tis sweet to sing of Him.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

Jesus, hail! Thy glory brightens
All above and gives it worth;
Lord of life, Thy smile enlightens,
Cheers, and charms Thy saints on earth.
When we think of love like Thine,
Lord, we own it love divine.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

King of glory, reign forever!
Thine an everlasting crown.
Nothing from Thy love shall sever
Those whom Thou hast made Thine own:
Happy objects of Thy grace,
Destined to behold Thy face.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

Savior, hasten Thine appearing:
Bring, oh, bring the glorious day,
When, the awful summons hearing,
Heav'n and earth shall pass away.
Then with raptured hearts we'll sing,
"Glory, glory to our King!"

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.--------150
Praise, praise ye the name of our Savior and God;
Declare, oh, declare ye His glories abroad;
Proclaim ye His mercy, from nation to nation,
Till the uttermost islands have heard His salvation.

  For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;
  And His mercy endureth forever and ever.

Praise, praise ye the Lamb, who for sinners was slain;
Who went down to the grave, and ascended again;
And who soon shall return, when these dark days are o'er,
To set up His kingdom, in glory and power.

  For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;
  And His mercy endureth forever and ever.

Then the heav'ns and the earth. and the sea shall rejoice;
The field and the forest shall lift their glad voice;
The sands of the desert shall flourish in green,
And Lebanon's glory be shed o'er the scene.

  For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;
  And His mercy endureth forever and ever.

Her bridal attire, and her festal array,
All nature shall see on that glorious day;
For her King cometh down with His people to reign,
And His presence shall bless her with glory in men.

  For His love floweth on, free and full as a river;
  And His mercy endureth forever and ever.--------151
Sing we the King who is coming to reign,
Glory to Jesus, the Lamb that was slain;
Righteousness, peace then His empire shall bring,
Joy to the nations when Jesus is King.

  Come let us sing: Praise to our King,
  Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
  This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
  Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

All men shall dwell in His marvelous light,
Races long severed His love shall unite,
Justice and truth from His scepter shall spring,
Wrong shall be ended when Jesus is King.

  Come let us sing: Praise to our King,
  Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
  This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
  Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

All shall be well in His kingdom of peace,
Freedom shall flourish and wisdom increase,
Foe shall be friend when His triumph we sing,
Sword shall be sickle when Jesus is King.

  Come let us sing: Praise to our King,
  Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
  This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
  Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

Knowledge and fear of the Lord then shall be
As the deep waters that cover the sea;
All things shall be in the splendor of spring
And all harmonious when Jesus is King.

  Come let us sing: Praise to our King,
  Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
  This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
  Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.

Kingdom of Christ, for thy coming we pray,
Hasten, O Father, the dawn of the day
When this new song Thy creation shall sing,
Satan is vanquished and Jesus is King.

  Come let us sing: Praise to our King,
  Jesus our King, Jesus our King:
  This is our song, who to Jesus belong:
  Glory to Jesus, to Jesus our King.--------152
O how deep and how far-reaching
Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!
Far beyond my pow'r to fathom,
Deeper than the deepest sea!
It has caused Thee death to suffer
And to me Thyself impart,
That in Thee I might be grafted
And become of Thee a part.

Who can tell of all the wonders
Which Thy love for me has wrought,
Yet the greatest of these wonders
Is that Thou to me art brought.
Oh! To me Thy love has given
All Thou art as my supply;
As true life I now may share Thee
And Thy riches e'er enjoy.

Lord, Thy love is the expression
Of Thy loving self divine,
Making life so full of meaning,
Harmonized with God's design.
Grace of life, how all-sufficient,
Is my portion day by day;
I'm the object of Thy favor
And Thy sweetness taste alway.

What from Thee can separate me?
Thou wilt love me to the end!
Oh! Thy love is so prevailing,
E'en Thyself with me to blend!
We two one will be for ever;
I am Thine and Thou art mine!
This will be my testimony:
In Thy love we'll ever twine!--------153
O blessd Savior, is Thy love
So great! So full! So free!
Fain would we have our thoughts, our hearts,
Our lives, engaged with Thee.

We love Thee for the glorious worth
Which in Thyself we see;
We love Thee for that shameful cross,
Endured so patiently.

No man of greater love can boast
Than for his friend to die;
Thou for Thine enemies wast slain!
What love with Thine can vie?

Though in the very form of God,
With heav'nly glory crowned,
Thou didst a servant's form assume,
Beset with sorrow round.

Thou wouldst like wretched man be made
In everything but sin,
That we as like Thee might become
As we unlike had been:

Like Thee in strength, in meekness, love,
In life in ev'ry phase;
From glory into glory changed,
Till we behold Thy face.

O Lord, we treasure in our hearts
The mem'ry of Thy love;
And ever shall Thy name to us
A grateful odor prove.--------154
It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine
Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
Know more and more.

It passeth telling, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior, Jesus; yet these lips of mine
Would fain proclaim to sinners, far and near,
A love which can remove all guilty fear,
And love beget.

It passeth praises, that dear love of Thine,
My Savior Jesus; yet this heart of mine
Would sing that love, so full, so rich, so free,
Which brings a rebel sinner, such as me,
Nigh unto God.

But though I cannot sing, or tell, or know
The fullness of Thy love, while here below,
My empty vessel I may freely bring;
O Thou, who art of love the living spring,
My vessel fill.

I am an empty vessel  not one thought
Or look of love to Thee I've ever brought;
Yet I may come, and come again to Thee,
With this the empty sinner's only plea,
Thou lovest me.

Oh, fill me, Jesus, Savior, with Thy love!
Lead, lead me to the living fount above;
Thither may I, in simple faith draw nigh,
And never to another fountain fly,
But unto Thee.

Lord Jesus, when Thee face to face I see,
When on Thy lofty throne I sit with Thee,
Then of Thy love, in all its breadth and length,
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,
My soul shall sing.--------155
Christ delivered me when bound,
And when bleeding, healed my wound;
Sought me wand'ring, set me right,
Turned my darkness into light.

Can a woman's tender care
Cease towards the child she bare?
Yes, she may forgetful be;
Yet will He remember me.

His is an unchanging love,
Higher than the heights above;
Deeper than the depths beneath,
Free and faithful, strong as death.

I shall see His glory soon,
When the work of grace is done;
Partner of His throne shall be;
Such is His great love for me!

Lord, it is my chief complaint
That my love is weak and faint;
Yet I love Thee, and adore:
Oh, for grace to love Thee more.--------156
I have a Friend, whose faithful love
Is more than all the world to me:
'Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
So old, so new,
So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me  Blessed be His name!

He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
To seek the lost,
And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me  Blessed be His name!

It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
Yet from the track
He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me  Blessed be His name!

Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
Was then made sin
On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me  Blessed be His name!

Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
My joy shall be
His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I'll praise Him  Blessed be His name!--------157
Lord Jesus, are we one with Thee?
O height, O depth of love!
Thou one with us on Calvary,
We one with Thee above.

Such was Thy grace that for our sake
Thou didst from heaven come down,
With us of flesh and blood partake,
In all our misery one.

Our sins, our guilt, in love Divine
Confessed and borne by Thee;
The gall, the curse, the wrath were Thine,
To set Thy members free.

Ascended now, in glory bright,
Head of the Church Thou art;
Nor life nor death, nor depth nor height,
Thy saints and Thee can part.

Oh teach us, Lord, to know and own
This wondrous mystery,
That Thou in heaven with us art one,
And we are one with Thee.

Soon, soon shall come that glorious day
When, seated on Thy throne,
Thou shalt to wondering worlds display
That Thou with us art one.--------158
Lord, Thy love has sought and found us
Wand'ring in this desert wide;
Thou hast thrown Thine arms around us,
For us suffered, bled, and died.
Sing, my soul! He lovd thee,
Jesus gave Himself for me.

Hark! What sounds of bitter weeping
From yon lonesome garden sweep;
'Tis the Lord His vigil keeping,
While His followers sink in sleep.
Ah, my soul, He lovd thee,
Yes, He gave Himself for me.

He is speaking to His Father,
Tasting deep that bitter cup,
Yet He takes it, willing rather
For our sakes to drink it up.
Oh, what love! He lovd me!
Gave Himself, my soul, for thee.

Then that closing scene of anguish:
All God's waves and billows roll
Over Him, there left to languish
On the cross, to save my soul.
Matchless love! How vast, how free,
Jesus gave Himself for me.

Hark again! His cries are waking
Echoes on dark Calvary's hill;
God, my God, art Thou forsaking
Him who always did Thy will?
Ah, my soul! It was for thee,
Yes! He gave Himself for me.

Lord, we joy, Thy toils are ended,
Glad Thy suff'ring time is o'er;
To Thy Father's throne ascended,
There Thou liv'st, to die no more.
Yes, my soul, He lives for thee,
He who gave Himself for me.

Lord, we worship and adore Thee
For Thy rich, Thy matchless grace;
Perfect soon in joy before Thee,
We shall see Thee face to face.
Yet e'en now our song shall be,
Jesus gave Himself for me.--------159
Give me a sight, O Savior,
Of Thy wondrous love to me,
Of the love that brought Thee down to earth,
To die on Calvary.

  Oh, make me understand it,
  Help me to take it in,
  What it meant to Thee, the Holy One,
  To bear away my sin.

Was it the nails, O Savior,
That bound Thee to the tree?
Nay, 'twas Thine everlasting love,
Thy love for me, for me.

  Oh, make me understand it,
  Help me to take it in,
  What it meant to Thee, the Holy One,
  To bear away my sin.

Oh, wonder of all wonders,
That through Thy death for me,
My open sins, my secret sins,
Can all forgiven be.

  Oh, make me understand it,
  Help me to take it in,
  What it meant to Thee, the Holy One,
  To bear away my sin.

Then melt my heart, O Savior,
Bend me, yea, break me down,
Until I own Thee Conqueror,
And Lord and Sov'reign crown

  Oh, make me understand it,
  Help me to take it in,
  What it meant to Thee, the Holy One,
  To bear away my sin.--------160
King of my life, I crown Thee now,
Thine shall the glory be;
Lest I forget Thy thorn-crowned brow,
Lead me to Calvary.

  Lest I forget Gethsemane;
  Lest I forget Thine agony;
  Lest I forget Thy love for me,
  Lead me to Calvary.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
Guarded Thee while Thou slept.

  Lest I forget Gethsemane;
  Lest I forget Thine agony;
  Lest I forget Thy love for me,
  Lead me to Calvary.

Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
Lead me to Calvary.

  Lest I forget Gethsemane;
  Lest I forget Thine agony;
  Lest I forget Thy love for me,
  Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear
Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
Thou hast borne all for me.

  Lest I forget Gethsemane;
  Lest I forget Thine agony;
  Lest I forget Thy love for me,
  Lead me to Calvary.

Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
For all that know not Thee;
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
To speak of Calvary.

  Lest I forget Gethsemane;
  Lest I forget Thine agony;
  Lest I forget Thy love for me,
  Lead me to Calvary.--------161
Praise the Savior, ye who know Him!
Who can tell how much we owe Him?
Gladly let us render to Him
All we are and have.

Jesus is the name that charms us;
He for conflicts fits and arms us;
Nothing moves and nothing harms us
When we trust in Him.

Trust in Him, ye saints, forever;
He is faithful, changing never;
Neither force nor guile can sever
Those He loves from Him.

Keep us, Lord, oh, keep us cleaving
To Thyself and still believing,
Till the hour of Thy receiving
The victorious Bride.

Then we shall be where we would be;
Then we shall be what we should be;
Things which are not now, nor could be,
Then shall be our own.--------162
With praise and thanksgiving there stands a great throng
In the presence of Jesus and sing this new song.

  Unto Him Who hath loved us and
  washed us from sin,
  Unto Him be the glory forever!
  Amen!

All these once were sinners, defiled in His sight,
Now arrayed in pure garments, in praise they unite.

  Unto Him Who hath loved us and
  washed us from sin,
  Unto Him be the glory forever!
  Amen!

He maketh the rebel a priest and a king,
He hath bought us, and taught us this new song to sing.

  Unto Him Who hath loved us and
  washed us from sin,
  Unto Him be the glory forever!
  Amen!

How helpless and hopeless we sinners had been,
If He never had loved us till cleansed from our sin.

  Unto Him Who hath loved us and
  washed us from sin,
  Unto Him be the glory forever!
  Amen!

Aloud in His praises our voices shall ring,
So that others, believing, this new song shall sing.

  Unto Him Who hath loved us and
  washed us from sin,
  Unto Him be the glory forever!
  Amen!--------163
O for a thousand tongues to sing
My great Redeemer's praise,
The glories of my God and King,
The triumphs of His grace.

My gracious Master and my God,
Assist me to proclaim,
To spread through all the earth abroad,
The honors of Thy name.

Jesus! The name that charms our fears,
That bids our sorrows cease;
'Tis music in the sinner's ears,
'Tis life, and health, and peace.

His love my heart has captive made,
His captive would I be,
For He was bound, and scourged and died,
My captive soul to free.

He breaks the power of canceled sin,
He sets the prisoner free;
His blood can make the foulest clean;
His blood availed for me.

So now Thy blessed Name I love,
Thy will would e'er be mine.
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
My Lord, they all were Thine!--------164
Let me sing, for the glory of heaven
Like a sunbeam has swept o'er my heart;
I would praise Thee for sins all forgiven,
For Thy love, which shall never depart.

If Thy works praise Thee, Giver of good,
If the sun shines his praise unto Thee,
If the wind, as it sighs through the wood,
Makes a murmur of song from each tree,

Then these lips, sure, a tribute shall bring,
Though unworthy the praises must be;
Shall all nature be vocal and sing,
And no psalm of rejoicing from me?

O wonderful, glorious Redeemer!
I would worship Thee, Savior Divine;
And rejoice, though surrounded with praises,
Thou wilt still hear a song such as mine.--------165
My song shall be of Jesus;
His mercy crowns my days,
He fills my cup with blessings,
And tunes my heart to praise.
My song shall be of Jesus,
The precious Lamb of God,
Who gave Himself my ransom,
And bought me with His blood.

My song shall be of Jesus
When, sitting at His feet,
I call to mind His goodness
In meditation sweet:
My song shall be of Jesus,
Whatever ill betide;
I'll sing the grace that saves me,
And keeps me at His side.

My song shall be of Jesus
While pressing on my way
To reach the blissful kingdom
Of pure and perfect day:
And when my soul shall enter
That realm of splendor fair,
A song of praise to Jesus
I'll sing forever there.--------166
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy health and salvation!
All ye who hear,
Now to His temple draw near;
Sing now in glad adoration!

Praise to the Lord, who o'er all things so wondrously reigneth,
Who, as on wings of an eagle, uplifteth, sustaineth.
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires all have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully, wondrously, made thee!
Health hath vouchsafed and, when heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
What need or grief
Ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper thy work and defend thee,
Who from the heavens the streams of His mercy doth send thee.
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with His love doth befriend thee.

Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again;
Gladly for aye we adore Him.--------167
How good is the Lord we adore,
Our faithful, unchangeable Friend;
His love is as great as His pow'r
And knows neither measure nor end.

'Tis Jesus the first and the last,
Who shall guide us through all to the throne;
We'll praise Him for all that is past,
We'll trust Him for all that's to come.--------168
Now in a song of grateful praise,
To Thee, O Lord, my voice I'll raise;
With all Thy saints I'll join to tell,
My Savior has done all things well.

  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  My Savior has done all things well.

How sov'reign, wonderful and free,
Has been Thy love to sinful me!
Thou sav'dst me from the jaws of hell;
My Savior has done all things well.

  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  My Savior has done all things well.

Since e'er my soul has known His love,
What mercies He has made me prove,
Mercies which do all praise excel,
My Savior has done all things well.

  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  My Savior has done all things well.

And when on that bright day I rise,
And join the anthems of the skies,
Above the rest this note shall swell,
My Savior has done all things well.

  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  This note shall swell, this note shall swell,
  And above the rest this note shall swell,
  My Savior has done all things well.--------169
*henna: an Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Songs 1:!4)

Thou, Lord, to God art precious,
His chosen, His delight;
With oil of joy, anointed,
How comely in His sight.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,

Our hearts their love declare.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,
  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.

The wise men offered treasures
And honored Thee at birth;
Thou wast by noble buried,
Still lovable in death.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,
  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.

Thy head has been anointed,
The lovely One Thou art;
Thy feet anointed also,
Beloved in every part.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,
  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.

Thy death as myrrh in sweetness
Man's spirit comforteth;
Thy resurrection fragrance
God's longing answereth.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,
  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.

As henna* flow'rs, Thy beauty
In loveliness complete;
As apple trees that flourish,
Thy fruit abundant, sweet.

  We treasure with affection

  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.

Sweet wine Thy love surpasseth,
Thy name an ointment is;

And all Thy beauty trace,
We taste to full Thy sweetness
And rest in Thine embrace.

  We treasure with affection
  Thy perfect comeliness,
  Thy sweetness and Thy fragrance,
  And all Thy loveliness.--------170
Lord, Thou art the lovely Bridegroom,
God appointed, dear to us;
Thy dear self is so attractive,
To our heart so beauteous!

Dear Beloved, we admire Thee,
Who can tell Thy preciousness;
All Thy love we deeply treasure
And Thine untold loveliness.

Thou art fairer than the fairest,
Thou art sweeter than the sweet;
Thou art meek and Thou art gracious,
None can e'er with Thee compete.

Full of myrrh are all Thy garments,
And Thy lips are filled with grace;
In the savor of Thy suffering,
We in love Thyself embrace.

It is with the oil of gladness
Thy God hath anointed Thee;
From the palaces of ivory
Praise shall ever rise to Thee.

God hath blessed Thee, Lord, forever,
Thou hast won the victory;
Now we see Thee throned in glory
With Thy pow'r and majesty.

Thou art the desire of nations,
All Thy worth they'll ever prove;
Thou, the chiefest of ten thousand,
Ever worthy of our love.--------171
*henna: an Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Songs 1:14)

Lord Jesus Christ, our heart feels sweet
Whene'er we think on Thee,
And long that to Thy presence dear
We soon might raptured be!

  Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
  In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
  Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
  Admires and loves our heart!

There is no music adequate
Thy grace in full to praise,
Nor there a heart which could enjoy
Thy love in every phase.

  Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
  In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
  Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
  Admires and loves our heart!

Yet, what delights our heart the most
Is not Thy love, Thy grace;
But it is Thine own loving Self
That satisfies always.

  Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
  In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
  Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
  Admires and loves our heart!

Oh, Thou art fairer than the fair,
And sweeter than the sweet;
Beside Thee, none in heaven or earth
Our heart's desire could meet.

  Lord, like the pretty henna*-flower,
  In vineyards blossoming Thou art;
  Incomp'rable Thy beauty is,
  Admires and loves our heart!--------172
  Repeat the last line of each verse

I cannot breathe enough of Thee,
O gentle breeze of love;
More fragrant than the myrtle tree
The Henna-flower is to me,
The Balm of Heav'n above.

I cannot gaze enough on Thee,
Thou Fairest of the Fair;
My heart is filled with ecstasy,
As in Thy face of radiancy
I see such beauty there.

I cannot yield enough to Thee,
My Savior, Master, Friend;
I do not wish to go out free,
But ever, always, willingly,
To serve Thee to the end.

I cannot sing enough of Thee,
The sweetest name on earth;
A note so full of melody
Comes from my heart so joyously,
And fills my soul with mirth.

I cannot speak enough of Thee,
I have so much to tell;
Thy heart it beats so tenderly
As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,
And whisper, "All is well."--------173
Thou art fairer than the morning,
O my Savior and my King!
Of Thy grandeur and Thy beauty,
How my soul delights to sing.

  Thou art fairer than the morning,
  Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
  At the glory of Thy presence
  Clouds and darkness flee away.

Clothed in light as with a garment,
Crowned with majesty divine,
Lo, the scepter of dominion
Now and ever, Lord, is Thine.

  Thou art fairer than the morning,
  Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
  At the glory of Thy presence
  Clouds and darkness flee away.

O the greatness of Thy mercy,
And the richness of Thy grace!
O the love that in Thy kingdom
Is preparing me a place!

  Thou art fairer than the morning,
  Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
  At the glory of Thy presence
  Clouds and darkness flee away.

When at last I reach the kingdom,
Win the crown, the battle o'er,
With ten thousand times ten thousand
I shall sing forevermore.

  Thou art fairer than the morning,
  Thou art brighter, brighter than the day;
  At the glory of Thy presence
  Clouds and darkness flee away.--------174
O Morning Star, how fair and bright,
Thou beamest forth in truth and light!
O Sov'reign meek and lowly,
Thou Root of Jesse, David's Son,
My Lord and Master, Thou hast won
My heart to serve Thee solely!
Thou art holy,
Fair and glorious, all-victorious,
Rich in blessing,
Rule and might o'er all possessing.

Thou heav'nly Brightness, Light divine,
O deep within my heart now shine,
And make Thee there an altar.
Fill me with joy and strength to be
Thy member, ever joined to Thee
In love that cannot falter;
Toward Thee longing
Doth possess me; turn and bless me;
Here in sadness
Eye and heart long for Thy gladness.--------175
Fairest Lord Jesus!
Ruler of all nature!
O Thou of God and man the Son!
Thee will I cherish,
Thee will I honor,
Thou, my soul's glory, joy, and crown!

Fair are the meadows,
Fairer still the woodlands,
Robed in the blooming garb of spring;
Jesus is fairer,
Jesus is purer,
Who makes the woeful heart to sing!

Fair is the sunshine,
Fairer still the moonlight,
And all the twinkling starry host;
Jesus shines brighter,
Jesus shines purer,
Than all the angels heav'n can boast!

All fairest beauty,
Heavenly and earthly,
Wondrously, Jesus, is found in Thee;
None can be nearer,
Fairer, or dearer,
Than Thou my Savior art to me.--------176
Jesus, wondrous Savior!
Christ, of kings the King!
Angels fall before Thee,
Prostrate, worshipping;
Fairest they confess Thee
In the heav'n above.
We would sing Thee fairest
Here in hymns of love.

All earth's flowing pleasures
Were a wintry sea;
Heav'n itself without Thee
Dark as night would be.
Lamb of God! Thy glory
Is the light above.
Lamb of God! Thy glory
Is the life of love.

Life is death, if severed
From Thy throbbing heart.
Death with life abundant
At Thy touch would start.
Worlds and men and angels
All consist in Thee,
Yet Thou camest to us
In humility.

Jesus! All perfections
Rise and end in Thee;
Brightness of God's glory
Thou, eternally.
Favored beyond measure
They Thy face who see;
May we, gracious Savior,
Share this ecstasy.--------177
  Repeat the last line of each verse

Majestic sweetness sits enthroned
Upon the Savior's brow;
His head with radiant glories crowned,
His lips with grace o'er flow.

No mortal can with Him compare
Among the sons of men;
Fairer is He than all the fair
That fill the heav'nly train.

To Him I owe my life and breath,
And all the joys I have;
He makes me triumph over death,
And saves me from the grave.

To God, the Father, my abode,
He brings my weary feet;
Shows me the glories of my God,
And makes my joys complete.

Since from His bounty I receive
Such proofs of love divine,
Had I a thousand hearts to give,
Lord, they should all be Thine.--------178
Our hearts are full of Christ and long
Their glorious matter to declare!
Of Him we make our loftier song,
We cannot from His praise forbear:
Our ready tongues make haste to sing
The glories of the heav'nly King.

Fairer than all the earthborn race,
Perfect in comeliness Thou art;
Replenished are Thy lips with grace,
And full of love Thy tender heart.
God ever-blest! We bow the knee,
And own all fulness dwells in Thee.--------179
Glory to Christ on high!
Let praises fill the sky!
Praise ye His name:
He all our sorrows bore;
Angels His name adore,
And saints cry evermore,
"Worthy the Lamb!"

All they around the throne
Cheerfully join in one,
Praising His name:
We who have known His blood
Sealing our peace with God,
Spread His dear name abroad;
Worthy the Lamb!

Join all the human race
Our Lord, God's Christ, to bless,
Praise ye His name:
In Him we will rejoice,
Making a cheerful noise,
Saying with heart and voice,
"Worthy the Lamb!"

Though we must change our place,
Our hearts shall never cease
Praising His name:
To Him we'll tribute bring,
Laud Him, our gracious King,
And, without ceasing, sing,
"Worthy the Lamb!"--------180
Jesus, our Lord, with what joy we adore Thee,
Chanting our praise to Thyself on the throne!
Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone.

  Lord, Thou art worthy: Lord, Thou art worthy;
  Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!
  Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
  Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

Verily God, yet become truly human,
Lower than angels to die in our stead;
How has that long promised "Seed of the woman"
Trod on the serpent and bruisd his head!

  Lord, Thou art worthy: Lord, Thou art worthy;
  Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!
  Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
  Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

How didst Thou humble Thyself to be taken,
Led by Thy creatures and nailed to the cross,
Hated of men, and of God too forsaken,
Shunning not darkness, the curse, and the loss.

  Lord, Thou art worthy: Lord, Thou art worthy;
  Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!
  Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
  Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!

How hast Thou triumphed, and triumphed with glory,
Battled death's forces, rolled back every wave!
Can we refrain then from telling the story?
Lord, Thou art Victor o'er death and the grave.

  Lord, Thou art worthy: Lord, Thou art worthy;
  Lord, Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!
  Blest in Thy presence, we worship before Thee,
  Own Thou art worthy, and worthy alone!--------181
'Tis the Church triumphant singing,
Worthy the Lamb;
Heav'n throughout with praises ringing,
Worthy the Lamb.
Thrones and pow'rs before Him bending,
Odors sweet with voice ascending
Swell the chorus never ending,
Worthy the Lamb.

Every kindred, tongue and nation,
Worthy the Lamb;
Join to sing the great salvation,
Worthy the Lamb.
Loud as mighty thunders roaring,
Floods of mighty waters pouring,
Prostrate at His feet adoring,
Worthy the Lamb.

Harps and songs forever sounding,
Worthy the Lamb;
Mighty grace o'er sin abounding,
Worthy the Lamb.
By His blood He dearly bought us;
Wand'ring from the fold He sought us,
And to glory safely brought us;
Worthy the Lamb.

Sing with blest anticipation
Worthy the Lamb;
Through the vale of tribulation,
Worthy the Lamb.
Sweetest notes, all notes excelling,
On the theme forever dwelling,
Still untold, though ever telling,
Worthy the Lamb.--------182
Jesus, Thou alone art worthy
Ceaseless praises to receive;
For Thy love and grace and goodness
Rise o'er all our thoughts conceive.

With adoring heart, we render
Honor to Thy precious name,
Overflowing with Thy mercies,
Far and wide Thy worth proclaim.

Praise Him! Praise Him! Praise the Savior!
Saints, aloud your voices raise,
Praise Him! Praise Him! Till in glory
Perfected we'll sing His praise.--------183
Come, let us join our cheerful songs,
And thus approach the throne;
Had we ten thousand thousand tongues,
Our theme of joy's but one:

"Worthy the Lamb that's gone on high,
To be exalted thus!"
"Worthy the Lamb that died!" we cry,
"For He was slain for us."

Jesus is worthy to receive
Honor and pow'r divine;
And blessings more than we can give
Be, Lord, forever Thine.

Soon shall the saints, exalted high,
A glorious anthem raise,
And all that dwell beneath the sky
Speak forth Thine endless praise.

Redeemed creation join in one,
T'adore the sacred name
Of Him that sits upon the throne,
And to exalt the Lamb.--------184
Come, let us sing the song of songs,
The saints of old began the strain,
The blessing which to Christ belongs:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!

Slain to redeem us by His blood,
To cleanse from every sinful stain;
And make us kings and priests to God;
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!

Long as we live, and should we die,
And while in light with Him we reign,
This song our song of songs shall be:
Worthy the Lamb, for He was slain!--------185
Blessed Lord, our hallelujahs
Now to Thee we raise.
Never could we fully utter
All Thy worth and praise!

  Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!
  Sweet eternal strain.
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord! Amen.

Praise the Lamb! Yes, Thou art worthy,
Who didst shed Thy blood
To redeem Thy saints, and make us
Kings and priests to God!

  Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!
  Sweet eternal strain.
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord! Amen.

Hallelujah! Thou, Lord Jesus,
Canst not cease to love;
Thine we are and Thine forever,
One with Thee above.

  Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!
  Sweet eternal strain.
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord! Amen.

Praise the Lord! Yes, hallelujah!
Who would hush the song?
Join with saints from every nation,
Every tribe and tongue.

  Praise the Lamb, for He is worthy!
  Sweet eternal strain.
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord! Amen.--------186
Glory be to Him who loved us,
Washed us from each sinful stain;
Glory be to Him who made us
Priests and kings with Him to reign;
Glory, worship, laud and blessing
To the Lamb who once was slain.

Glory, worship, laud and blessing,
Thus the choir triumphant sings;
Honor, riches, power, dominion,
Thus its praise creation brings;
Thou art worthy, Thou art worthy,
Lord of lords, and King of kings.

Glory to the King of angels,
Glory to the Church's King,
Glory to the King of nations,
Heaven and earth His praises sing;
Glory ever and forever
To the King of Glory bring.--------187

And earth is joined to heaven.

Who all our need doth furnish;

Lord, Thou art the "Seed of woman,"
Born to bruise the enemy;
Thou didst take the human nature,
Die to win the victory.
As the very God incarnate,
Flesh and blood Thou didst partake;
Thou thru death hast crushed the devil
And his pow'r of death didst break.

"Seed of Abraham," Thou art, Lord,
By God's promise Thou hast come,
That the blessing He hath promised
On all people thus might come.
Abraham Thou hast preceded,
For Thou art the great "I AM,"
Yet Thou cam'st to be his offspring
And become God's promised "Lamb."

Lord, Thou art the "Seed of David,"
For the kingdom Thou wast raised;
For God's glory and His building
On the throne Thou hast been placed.
Truly Thou art "David's offspring,"
Yet "my Lord" he calleth Thee,
For Thou art his "root" and fountain,
"Lord of all" eternally.

Though "a child" born with our nature,
Thou the "Mighty God" art called;
Thou, "a son." to us art given,
"Everlasting Father" called.
All the blessings God hath promised,
With our faith on Thee depend;
Thou art "Yea" and "Amen" for them,
All the content and the end!--------192
We come, O Christ, to Thee,
True Son of God and man,
By whom all things consist,
In whom all life began:
In Thee alone we live and move
And have our being in Thy love.

Thy blood our ransom paid;
In Thee we face our Judge
And Maker unafraid.
Before the Throne absolved we stand:
Thy love has met Thy law's demand.

Thou art the living Truth!
All wisdom dwells in Thee,
Thou Source of every skill,
Eternal Verity!
Thou great I Am! In Thee we rest,
True answer to our every quest.

The more abundant life
That earth can never give:
O Risen Lord! We live in Thee
And Thou in us eternally!

Adoringly we bring:
So fill our hearts that men may see
Thy life in us and turn to Thee!--------193

Thou art our all in all;

Though they be great or small.
Our hearts appreciate what Thou art,
Our spirits worship Thee;
Our grateful praise to Thee we give
As we Thy riches see.

Thou art the Prophet raised by God,
With pow'r for God to speak;
Like Moses, Thou God's plan hast shown,
That we God's will may seek.
Thou art like Jonah sent by God,
To enter death and live,
That by this sign of death and life,
We may in Thee believe.

Thou art the Prophet raised from men,
To speak with pow'r and light;
Thou, like Elisha, filled with love,
Thy miracles in might.
Thou, like Isaiah, full of grace,
God's Christ dost e'er reveal,
That we may share this Christ of all
As life both rich and real.

The holy Priest for us,
Like Aaron called of God from men,
For us Thou servest thus.
In love Thou bearest us to God,
The great High Priest to serve;
With love Thou intercedest there
And dost with strength preserve.

The royal Priest of God;
Like Salem's King, Melchisedec,
The minister of God.
With bread and wine Thou cam'st from God
To us in time of need;

Might fully share indeed.

Thou art the King as David was,
And God's desire dost seek;
The battle fought, the foe subdued,
God's heart Thou dost bespeak.
Thou art empowered on the throne,
Not with a human rod,
But with authority divine
To reign for us and God.

Thou art the King like Solomon,
Whose rule with peace was filled;
With wisdom Thou dost reign in pow'r
And Thou God's house dost build.
As King unseen Thou reignest now
Among Thy saints with love;

We all with love avow.
O how we treasure what Thou art,
Our hearts are drawn by Thee;

Thou art God's testimony, Lord,
Much better than the law;
The law in letter was engraved,
In it Thy type men saw.
A definition was the law,
God's picture to provide;
But Thou art God's reality,
In Thee doth God abide.

The ark of testimony too
Was but a type of Thee;
In it the law of God was placed,
But God in Thee we see.
The ark, in type, was made of wood
And. overlaid with gold;
It typifies Thee as a man,
Who God in full doth hold.

Thou art the tabernacle too,
God's holy dwelling place;
Incarnate in the flesh Thou art,
And full of truth and grace.
God's glory we behold in Thee,
Thou art the Word divine;
Thy words and deeds of love and light
Do God in life define.

The temple was a type of Thee;
The house of God Thou art;
God dwells in Thee, Himself to show,
His fulness to impart.
Though Thou by Satan wast destroyed
And numbered with the dead,
In resurrection Thou dost build
A larger one instead.

The city shows Thy fulness true,
A figure of Thy Bride,
The increase of Thyself in full,
In whom Thou dost abide.
In Thee is God, the light divine,
The lamp in her art Thou;
With Thee God shines thru her on all,
His glory to avow.

The tabernacle and the ark,
The law within them stored,
The temple and the city too,
Are all Thyself, dear Lord.
Thou art the hub, Thou art the rim,
The all in all Thou art!
In Thee we see both God and man,
How precious to our heart!--------195
Lord, Thou art all the offerings
Prepared by God for us;
They are so rich in meaning,
So sweet and glorious.
They have fulfilled God's purpose
And met His heart's desire;
They too have satisfied us,
And faced what we require.

Thou art the burnt-oblation,
Consumed by holy fire;
To God as a sweet savor,
Fulfilling His desire.
Thou walkedst in God's presence,
And all His will pursued;
Thyself the spotless offering,
For us to God as food.

Thou art the meal-oblation,
With "oil" and "frankincense";
'Tis holy, fine, and perfect,
And sweet to every sense.'

The peace for us to make,
That we with God may share Thee,
As food of Thee partake.

Thou art the sin-oblation,
For us Thou sin wast made;
By death for our redemption
The ransom Thou hast paid.
Thou art the trespass-offering,
Thou all our sins didst bear
To satisfy God's justice,
That we His pardon share.

Thou art the wave-oblation,
The resurrected One;
O'er Hades, death and darkness,
The vict'ry Thou hast won.
Thou art the heave-oblation,
Thou didst ascend to God;
As such in heav'nly places
Thou art our holy food.--------196
Lord, the ancient types and symbols
As our all Thyself portrayed;
As was shadowed in those figures,
Real to us Thou now art made.
Contemplating such a picture,
As we on its wonders gaze,
How we marvel at Thy riches
And our song of worship raise.

Lord, Thou art our true Passover,
God passed over us thru Thee;
By Thyself and Thy redemption
We with God have harmony.
Thou, the Lamb of God, redeemedst us
With Thyself and with Thy blood;
We apply Thy blood, our ransom,
Eating Thee, our real food.

Lord, Thou art the Bread from heaven,
The unleavened Bread of life;
Eating Thee, with Thee we mingle,
Ceasing from our sin and strife.
Lamb and Bread are both Thy figures,
Showing Thou art life to us;
Feasting on Thee at Thy table,
We enjoy Thy riches thus.

Lord, Thou art the Heav'nly Manna,
As our daily food supply;
Strengthening and energizing,
All our need to satisfy.
Living Rock Thou also art, Lord,
Cleft for us with life to flow;
Drinking of this living water,
Thirst is quenched, Thy life we know.

Lord, Thou art the Land of Canaan
Elevated, rich and good,
Flowing with both milk and honey
In a glorious plenitude.
By Thy surplus God we worship,
In Thy fellowship we move;
Thus in love we're joined together
And God's building we will prove.--------197
How all-inclusive, Lord, Thou art;
Of God we are in Thee
The portion God prepared for us,
Our all in all to be.

Thou art to us God's wisdom true,
We all are saved through Thee;
Thou art God's only way to save,
Thou art our only plea.

Thou art to us our righteousness,
All God requires to meet;
In Thee we all are justified,
In Thee we are complete.

Thou art to us our holiness
That we may be transformed;
In Thee we all are sanctified,
To Thee we'll be conformed.

Thou art to us redemption too,
That we Thy likeness bear;
Transfigured will our bodies be
Thy liberty to share.

Dear Lord, while we remember Thee,
Enjoying all Thou art,
We thus would hasten Thy return
And ne'er from Thee depart.

How sweet to have this foretaste here,
A taste so wonderful,
Yet still we fain would be with Thee,
And share Thyself in full.--------198
Dear Lord, Thou art the Tree of Life,
The very life supply;
Thy fruits, replete with life divine,
Our hunger satisfy.

Thou art the true and heav'nly Vine,
Our very source of life;
By Thee we live, in Thee abide,
And rest from all our strife.

Dear Lord, Thou art the Apple Tree,
Thyself we all enjoy;
Thy fruits are sweet to all our taste,
Thy shadow brings us joy.

Thou art to us the healing Tree;
Our death Thou didst endure;
Thou on a tree for us wast slain,
That we may have Thy cure.

Thou art the very Branch of God,
'His fulness dwells in Thee;
In Thee we take of Him as grace
And the reality.

Lord, Thou art also David's Branch
Incarnate here to be;
In Thee we see and comprehend
The true humanity.

Thou art the sprouting Rod with God,
In Thee is endless life,
Before Thy resurrection pow'r
Death never can be rife.

Thou also art the swimming Stick,
The fallen "ax" are we;
By Thine uplifting pow'r of life,
From death we're lifted free.

Lord, Thou art such a "Plant of Fame,"
Of Thee we richly share;
As we are here remembering Thee,
Thyself we thus declare!--------199
Thou art the Rock everlasting,
Spiritual Rock cleft for me;
Drinking of Thee as the Spirit,
Thus I become one with Thee.
Thou art the Rock never shaken,
'Tis on this Rock we are built;
Joined unto Thee thru redemption,
Nothing can shake us thru guilt.

  Lord, how we treasure Thy value,
  All that Thou art is for us;
  While here in loving remembrance
  We share Thy wealth glorious.

Thou art the Stone tried by many,
Precious to God, dear to us,
Thou art so sure and trustworthy,
Thy strength is so marvelous.
Thou art the Stone that is living,
Chosen of God, made our own;
So energetic and pow'rful,
With endless life to us known.

  All that Thou art is for us;
  While here in loving remembrance
  We share Thy wealth glorious.

Thou art the Stone of Foundation

Which we have now and for aye.

Caused Thee on us to dawn,
To those in darkness giving light
That shades of death be gone.

To us as a reward;
While still 'tis dark it shines with light
To those who love the Lord.

And the Omega too;

And art the Last so true.

The only End of all;
In Thee all is included,
Creations great and small.

Lord, since Thou art the Alpha,
All things commenced of Thee;
And as the sole Omega,
All things will end in Thee;

Stanza 5 is found in the Chinese hymnal only.

In the bosom of the Father,
Ere the ages had begun,
Thou wast in the Father's glory,
God's unique begotten Son.
When to us the Father gave Thee,
Thou in person wast the same,
All the fulness of the Father
In the Spirit to proclaim.

By Thy death and resurrection,
Thou wast made God's firstborn Son;
By Thy life to us imparting,
Was Thy duplication done.
We, in Thee regenerated,
Many sons to God became;
Truly as Thy many brethren,
We are as Thyself the same.

Once Thou wast the only grain, Lord,
Falling to the earth to die,
That thru death and resurrection
Thou in life may multiply.
We were brought forth in Thy nature
And the many grains became;
As one loaf we all are blended,
All Thy fulness to proclaim.

We're Thy total reproduction,
Thy dear Body and Thy Bride,
Thine expression and Thy fulness,
For Thee ever to abide.
We are Thy continuation,
Thy life-increase and Thy spread,
Thy full growth and Thy rich surplus,
One with Thee, our glorious Head.

(Stanza 5 is found in the Chinese hymnal only)
Lord Thy human shell was broken.
Life and glory Thou released
That thine own incorporation
With thy chosen be increased.
We with Thee incorporated:
Thou in us and we in Thee.
Here we eat the hidden manna,
New Jerusalem to be.--------204
Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus,
Losing sight of all but Thee,
O what joy Thy presence gives us,
Calling up our hearts to Thee!

Loved with love which knows no measure,
Save the Father's love to Thee,
Blessed Lord, our hearts would treasure
All the Father's thoughts of Thee.

All His joy, His rest, His pleasure
All His deep delight in Thee
Lord, Thy heart alone can measure
What Thy Father found in Thee.

How He set His love upon Thee
Called Thee His beloved Son;
Yet for us He did not spare Thee,
By Thy death our life was won.

O the joy, the wondrous singing,
When we see Thee as Thou art!
Thy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing
Sweetest music to God's heart.

Notes of gladness, songs unceasing,
Hymns of everlasting praise,
Psalms of glory, joy increasing,
Through God's endless day of days.--------205
Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,
Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,
From the best bliss that earth imparts,
We turn unfilled to Thee again.

Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
Thou savest those that on Thee call;
To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,
To them that find Thee, all in all!

We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
And long to feast upon Thee still;
We drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,
And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!

Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
Where'er our changeful lot is cast;
Glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.

O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay!
Make all our moments calm and bright,
Chase all dark thoughts of sin away,
Shed o'er us here Thy holy light.--------206
O Christ, He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of life:
Its living streams I've tasted
Which save from grief and strife.
And to an ocean fullness,
His mercy doth expand;
His grace is all-sufficient
As by His wisdom planned.

O I am my Beloved's.
And my Beloved's mine;
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into His house of wine!
I stand upon His merit;
I know no other stand.
I'm hidden in His presence
And held by His own hand.

The Bride eyes not her garment,
But her dear Bridegroom's face;
I will not gaze at glory.
But on my King of grace:
Not at the crown He giveth,
But on His piercd hand;
The Lamb is all the glory,
And my eternal stand!--------207
Lord Jesus! when we think of Thee,
Of all Thy love and grace,
Our spirits long and fain would see
Thy beauty face to face.

And though the wilderness we tread,
A barren, thirsty ground,
With thorns and briars overspread,
Where foes and snares abound;

Yet in Thy love such depths we see,
Our hearts o'erflow with praise
Content ourselves, while, Lord to Thee
A joyful song we raise.

Our Lord, our Life, our Rest, our Shield,
Our Rock, our Food, our Light;
Each thought of Thee doth constant yield
Unchanging, fresh delight.

Blest Savior, keep our spirit stayed,
Hard following after Thee,
Till we, in victory displayed,
Thy face in glory see.--------208
O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!
Forgive me if I say,
For very love, Thy sacred name
A thousand times a day.

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!

I love Thee so I know not how
My transports to control;
Thy love is like a burning fire
Within my very soul.

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!

For Thou to me art all in all;
My honor and my wealth;
My heart's desire, my body's strength,
My soul's eternal health.

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!

Burn, burn, O love, within my heart,
Burn fiercely night and day,
Till all the dross of earthly loves
Is burned, and burned away.

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!

O light in darkness, joy in grief,
O heaven's life on earth;
Jesus, my love, my treasure, who
Can tell what Thou art worth?

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!

What limit is there to this love?
Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?
On, on! Our Lord is sweeter far
Today than yesterday.

  O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
  I rest in Thee, whate'er betide;
  Thy gracious smile is my reward;
  I love, I love Thee, Lord!--------209
Jesus, the very thought of Thee
With sweetness fills my breast;
But sweeter far Thy face to see,
And in Thy presence rest.

Nor voice can sing, nor heart can frame,
Nor can the memory find
A sweeter sound than Thy blest Name,
O Savior of mankind!

O Hope of every contrite heart,
O Joy of all the meek,
To those who fall, how kind Thou art!
How good to those who seek!

But what to those who find? Ah, this
Nor tongue nor pen can show;
The love of Jesus, what it is
None but His loved ones know.

O Jesus! Light of all below!
Thou fount of life and fire!
Surpassing all the joys we know,
And all we can desire.

No other source have we but Thee,
Soul-thirst to satisfy.
Exhaustless spring! The waters free!
All other streams are dry.

Jesus, our only Joy be Thou,
As Thou our Prize wilt be;
Jesus, be Thou our Glory now,
And through eternity.--------210
I've found a friend in Jesus, He's everything to me,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul;
The Apple-tree of trees, in Him alone I see
All I need to cleanse and make me fully whole.
In sorrow He's my comfort, in trouble He's my stay,
He tells me every care on Him to roll:
He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

He all my griefs has taken, and all my sorrows borne;
In temptation He's my strong and mighty tower;
I've all for Him forsaken, and all my idols torn
From my heart, and now He keeps me by His power.
Though all the world forsake me, and Satan tempt me sore,
Through Jesus I shall safely reach the goal:
He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.

He'll never, never leave me, nor yet forsake me here,
While I live by faith and do His blessd will;
A wall of fire about me, I've nothing now to fear,
With His manna He my hungry soul shall fill.
Then sweeping up to glory to see His blessed face,
Where rivers of delight shall ever roll:
He's the Apple-tree of trees, the Bright and Morning Star,
He's the fairest of ten thousand to my soul.--------211
Jesus, my Savior! Thou art mine,
The Father's gift of love divine;
All Thou hast done, and all Thou art,
Are now the portion of my heart.

Poor, feeble, wretched, as I am,
I now can glory in Thy name;
Now cleansed in Thy most precious blood
And made the righteousness of God.

All that Thou hast Thou hast for me,
All my fresh springs are hid in Thee;
In Thee I live; while I confess
I nothing am, yet all possess.

O Savior, teach me to abide
Close sheltered at Thy wounded side,
Each hour receiving "grace on grace"
Until I see Thee face to face.--------212
Lord Jesus, gladly do our lips express
Our heart's deep sense of all Thy worthiness;
Thou risen One, the Holy and the True,
We give Thee now the praise so justly due.

Thou giv'st us, Lord, once more to taste down here
The joy Thy presence brings, its warmth and cheer;
With great delight we 'neath Thy shadow rest;
Thy fruit is sweet to those Thy love has blest.

Thou wast alone, till like the precious grain
In death Thou layest, but didst rise again;
And in Thy risen life a countless host
Are "all of one" with Thee, Thy joy and boast.--------213
On that same night, Lord Jesus,
When all around Thee joined
To cast its darkest shadow
Across Thy holy mind,
We hear Thy voice, blest Savior,
"This do, remember me",
With grateful hearts responding,
We do remember Thee.

The depth of all Thy suffering
No heart could e'er conceive,
The cup of wrath o'erflowing
For us Thou didst receive;
And, oh, of God forsaken
On the accursd tree;
With grateful hearts, Lord Jesus,
We now remember Thee.

We think of all the darkness
Which round Thy spirit pressed,
Of all those waves and billows,
Which rolled across Thy breast.
Oh, there Thy grace unbounded
And perfect love we see;
With joy and sorrow mingling,
We would remember Thee.

We know Thee now as risen,
The Firstborn from the dead;
We see Thee now ascended,
The Church's glorious Head.
In Thee by grace accepted,
The heart and mind set free
To think of all Thy sorrow,
And thus remember Thee.

Till Thou shalt come in glory,
And call us hence away,
To rest in all the brightness
Of that unclouded day,
We show Thy death, Lord Jesus,
And here would seek to be
More to Thy death conformd,
While we remember Thee.--------214
According to Thy gracious word,
In meek humility,
This will I do, my dying Lord,
I will remember Thee.

Thy body, broken for my sake,
My bread from heaven shall be;
Thy testamental cup I take,
And thus remember Thee.

Gethsemane can I forget?
Or there Thy conflict see,
Thine agony and bloody sweat,
And not remember Thee?

When to the cross I turn mine eyes
And rest on Calvary,
O Lamb of God, my sacrifice,
I must remember Thee

Remember Thee and all Thy pains
And all Thy love to me;
Yea, while a breath, a pulse remains,
I will remember Thee.

And when these failing lips grow dumb
And mind and memory flee,
When Thou shalt in Thy kingdom come,
Jesus, remember me.--------215
Jesus, Lord, we know Thee present
At Thy table freshly spread,
Seated at Thy priceless banquet
With Thy banner overhead.
Precious moments at Thy table,
From all fear and doubt set free;
Here to rest, so sweetly able,
Occupied alone with Thee.

Here rejoicing in Thy nearness,
Gladly by Thy Spirit led;
Calmly in the blest remembrance
Of Thyself, Thy blood once shed.
Lord, we take each simple token
In fond memory of Thee,
Muse upon Thy body broken
And Thy blood shed on the tree.

Oh, what joy it is to see Thee,
In these chosen emblems here;
In the bread and wine of blessing
Bread to strengthen, wine to cheer!
Lord, behold us met together,
One in Thee, our risen Head,
Thus we take the cup of blessing,
Thus we share the broken bread.

Lord, we know how true Thy promise
To be with us where we meet,
When in Thy loved name we gather
To enjoy communion sweet;
Dearer still that looked-for promise
To each waiting, yearning heart,
That with Thee we soon shall be, Lord,
Yes, "forever" where Thou art.--------216
Around Thy table, holy Lord,
In fellowship we meet,
Obedient to Thy gracious word,
This feast of love to eat.

Here every one that loves Thy name,
Our willing hearts embrace;
Our source of life and hope the same,
All debtors to Thy grace.

Commune with each at this blest hour,
Thy peace, Thy joy impart;
Thy thoughts of love, of truth, of pow'r,
Impress upon each heart.--------217
On that night of nights most solemn,
Jesus call His own
'Round the table of remembrance,
All alone.

Then this feast of feasts He ordered,
Feast of grace Divine;
Sacred symbols He appointed,
Bread and wine.

Thus His death of deaths is shadowed
In this simple way,
Looking backward, pointing upward,
To that day.

Till the morn of morns bright dawning,
Earth's dark shadows passed;
And the splendor of God's glory
Breaks at last.

Thus the day of days shall open,
Deathless, cloudless, fair;
In that day, the Savior's glories
We shall share!--------218
As gathered in Thy precious name,
This table we surround,
Thy death, Lord Jesus, to proclaim,
O may our praise abound.

We give what from Thee we receive,
For all we have is Thine
O may each heart with joy believe,
And echo "Thine is mine!"

Grace, grace it was that brought Thee down;
Love shone in all Thy ways;
Through death Thine is the Victor's crown,
And Thine the endless praise.

We, here, in silence, or in song,
Together worship Thee;
Before our God we shall ere long
Give praise eternally.

Lord Jesus Christ, Thou comest soon
Today Thy death we show;
In light, eclipsing sun at noon,
Its myst'ry we shall know.--------219
Lord Jesus Christ, we would remember Thee,
As, on the table, we the emblems see;
Thy holy body shadowed in the bread,
Thy precious blood is in the cup portrayed.

Lord, we adore Thee for Thy matchless grace,
That Thou, for us, didst take the servant's place;
From Godhead's glory to the shameful tree,
From wealth, so vast, to abject poverty!

O Lamb of God, we join to bless Thy name,
That Thou, on Calv'ry, bore our sin and shame;
And, by Thy death, didst put our guilt away,
Triumphant rose, our night to turn to day.

We see Thee now, at God's right hand enthroned,
Vested with honor and with glory crowned;
Blessed Redeemer, Savior, Lord, to Thee
Be all the glory, pow'r and majesty!--------220
When on Thy table, Lord, we gaze,
We marvel at the signs:
A loaf of bread, a cup of wine,
Displayed as God designs.

The loaf portrays the bread of life
As heav'nly food to us,
Imparted by Thy mystic death
That we may share Thee thus.

The portion is the cup divine,
Composed of Jesus' blood;
This cup of blessing we receive
And gain what is of God.

We eat of Thee, the Bread of life,
By sharing here this bread;
Thus we remember Thee in love
And with Thyself are fed.

We all enjoy the blessings gained
By drinking of this cup;
Thus we remember Thee with joy,
Till we are taken up.

By feasting on this bread and cup
Thy death we now declare,
And testify Thou art our life
And all we daily share.

We're waiting for that glorious hour,
When in the fullest way
We'll feed on Thee and feast with Thee
And worship Thee for aye.--------221
Lord, we thank Thee for the table,
With the bread and with the wine;
At this table we enjoy Thee
As the feast of love divine.
We partake the bread, the emblem
Of Thy body giv'n for us;
And we share the wine, the symbol
Of Thy blood Thou shedd'st for us.

  Lo, the holy table!
  With the sacred symbols;
  Its significance in figure
  Is unsearchable!

By the death of Thy redemption,
That Thy life Thou may impart,
E'en Thyself to us Thou gavest
That we share in all Thou art.
By the bread and wine partaking,
We Thy death display and prove;
Eating, drinking of Thyself, Lord,
We remember Thee with love.

  Lo, the holy table!
  With the sacred symbols;
  Its significance in figure
  Is unsearchable!

By this bread which signifieth
Thy one body mystical,
We commune with all Thy members
In one bond identical.
By this holy cup of blessing,
Cup of wine which now we bless,
Of Thy blood we have communion
With all those who faith possess.

  Lo, the holy table!
  With the sacred symbols;
  Its significance in figure
  Is unsearchable!

Thou art our eternal portion,
Here we take a sweet foretaste;
We are waiting for Thy kingdom,
And Thy coming now we haste.
At Thy coming, in Thy kingdom,
With all saints that overcome,
We anew will feast upon Thee
And Thy loving Bride become.

  Lo, the holy table!
  With the sacred symbols;
  Its significance in figure
  Is unsearchable!--------222
Dear Lord, we thank Thee for this bread,
It is a sign divine;
In it we see the mysteries
Of God's unique design.

This bread Thy body signifies,
Which Thou hast giv'n for us,
That we may share Thy life divine,
Partaking of Thee thus.

For us Thy body Thou didst break
That Thou may thus impart
Thyself as life to us that we
May be Thy counterpart.

This bread thus also signifies
Thy body mystical,
Of which we living members are,
With Thee identical.

Though we are many grains of wheat,
Yet all one loaf, one bread;
Remembering Thee in such a way,
With Thee we all are fed.

As of this bread we all commune,
Thou, Lord, dost satisfy,
With all the saints we fellowship,
And Thee we testify.--------223
On the table of Thy love,
With the bread, the cup is spread.
By partaking of these signs,
We with Thee are richly fed.
How we thank Thee for this cup,
For the cup of blessing, Lord,
Cup of Thy Salvation full,
Cup of all Thou dost afford.

'Tis the blood Thou shedd'st for us,
That our sins may be forgiv'n;
'Tis the cov'nant made for us,
That Thy blessings may be giv'n.
Thou didst drink the cup of wrath,
Thou hast tasted death for us,
Thus the cup of blessing bought,
As the portion gained for us.

In this portion we have God,
Whom we lost thru Adam's fall;
By the shedding of Thy blood,
God becomes our all in all.
In this portion all we have
Life and peace, redemption sure;
All that God has planned and willed,
In this portion we secure.

An eternal portion, 'tis,
Overflowing cup divine;
Heav'nly taste do we enjoy
In this cup of God's design.
Here in love we drink this cup
In remembrance, Lord, of Thee;
Thus in spirit we partake
All Thy work on Calvary.--------224
As we're sharing of the cup,
How can we restrain our praise;
For the blood Thou shedd'st for us,
Worth of which none can appraise.
O how precious is Thy blood!
All our problems it resolves;
In Thine efficacious blood
All our care and fear dissolves.

It is by this blood of worth
The new testament was made;
For this better covenant,
'Tis a sure foundation laid.
We have been redeemed by God,
Not with silver or with gold,
But, Lord, with Thy precious blood,
Which Thy love doth e'er unfold.

For remission of our sins
Thou hast shed Thy cleansing blood,
Which for us has fully met
All the righteous claims of God.
Thou hast washed us from our sins
In Thy pow'rful purging blood;
And our conscience purged by it,
Thus to serve the living God.

By Thy separating blood,
We have all been sanctified;
'Tis by Thy preserving blood
Holiness is testified.
By Thy propitiating blood,
We have all been justified;
'Tis by Thy redeeming blood
God is fully satisfied.

Thru Thy blood shed on the cross,
We are reconciled to God,
That the way to contact Him
May in peace by us be trod.
By partaking of Thy blood,
We have Thine eternal life;
In Thy blood and life received,
We have rest, free from all strife.

Now, in heav'n Thy sprinkled blood
Speaks for us of better things;
Under its defending pow'r
We are kept from Satan's stings.
By Thine overcoming blood,
We defeat the enemy;
Over our accuser thus,
We will have the victory.

Of Thy blood, for fellowship,
We commune with all the saints;
Under its full covering,
Our freed spirit never faints.
How can we exhaust, in words,
The account of Thy dear blood;
We will need eternity
To declare its boundless good.--------225
Here, O my Lord, I see Thee face to face;
Here faith can touch and handle things unseen;
Here would I grasp with firmer hand Thy grace,
And all my weariness upon Thee lean.

Here would I feed upon the Bread of God;
Here drink with Thee the royal wine of heav'n;
Here would I lay aside each earthly load;
Here taste afresh the calm of sin forgiv'n.

I have no help but Thine; nor do I need
Another arm save Thine to lean upon;
It is enough, my Lord, enough indeed;
My strength is in Thy might, Thy might alone.

This is the hour of banquet and of song;
This is the heav'nly table spread for me;
Here let me feast, and, feasting, still prolong
The brief bright hour of fellowship with Thee.

Too soon we rise; the symbols disappear;
The feast, though not the love, is past and gone;
The bread and wine remove, but Thou art here,
Nearer than ever still our Shield and Sun.

Feast after feast thus comes and passes by,
Yet passing, points to the glad feast above,
Giving sweet foretastes of the festal joy,
The Lamb's great bridal-feast of bliss and love.--------226
For the bread and for the wine,
For the pledge that seals Him mine,
For the words of love divine,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

Only bread and only wine,
Yet to faith, the solemn sign
Of the heav'nly and divine!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

For the words that turn our eye
To the cross of Calvary,
Bidding us in faith draw nigh,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

For the words that fragrance breathe
These plain symbols underneath,
Words that His own peace bequeath,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

For Thy words in Spirit shown,
For Thy will to us made known,
"Do ye this until I come,"
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

Till He come we take the bread,
Type of Him on whom we feed,
Him who liveth and was dead!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

Till He come we take the cup;
As we at His table sup,
Eye and heart are lifted up!
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.

For that coming, here foreshown,
For that day to man unknown,
For the glory and the throne,
We give Thee thanks, O Lord.--------227
Through the bread and cup, Lord Jesus,
We Thy death exhibit here;
What Thy love has done reviewing,
All Thy suff'ring we revere.
Bread and cup in separation,
Show that Thou thru death hast gone;
Grateful now, our spirit worships,
And to Thee we give our song.

  Thine the cup of suff'ring,
  Mine the cup of blessing;
  For Thy love in Thy redemption,
  Praise we ever sing!

Thou, in love, hast shed Thy blood, Lord,
Bringing us to God in grace,
That from God, no longer severed,
We may ever see His face.
All God's righteousness and glory
Have been fully satisfied;
Thru Thy death's abundant merit
We may now with God abide.

  Thine the cup of suff'ring,
  Mine the cup of blessing;
  For Thy love in Thy redemption,
  Praise we ever sing!

By Thy death the veil was riven,
Opened was the holiest place,
All the barriers have been broken;
We approach the throne of grace,
There receiving grace and mercy,
Thus the timely need to meet,
Drinking as of living water,
Tasting God Himself replete.

  Thine the cup of suff'ring,
  Mine the cup of blessing;
  For Thy love in Thy redemption,
  Praise we ever sing!

Thou in grace hast so redeemed us,
We the priests may be fore'er
To fulfill that holy office,
All God's sweetness thus to share.
Such a blessing, such a mercy,
From Thy death for us ensue;
We would ever Thee remember
Till with Thee we drink anew.

  Thine the cup of suff'ring,
  Mine the cup of blessing;
  For Thy love in Thy redemption,
  Praise we ever sing!--------228
Sweet feast of love divine!
'Tis grace that makes us free
To feed upon this bread and wine,
In mem'ry, Lord, of Thee.

Here every welcome guest
Waits, Lord, from Thee to learn
The secrets of Thy Father's breast,
And all Thy grace discern.

Here conscience ends its strife,
And faith delights to prove
The sweetness of the Bread of Life,
The fulness of Thy love.

That blood that flowed for sin
In symbol here we see,
And feel the blessed pledge within
That we are loved of Thee.

O if this glimpse of love
Is so divinely sweet,
What will it be, O Lord, above,
Thy gladd'ning smile to meet!

To see Thee face to face,
Thy perfect likeness wear,
And all Thy ways of wondrous grace
Through endless years declare.--------229
Gathered round Thyself, Lord Jesus,
We now seek Thy face;
May we know Thy presence with us,
Lord of grace!

Love divine first drew us to Thee,
In our sin and need;
For our sin, in deep compassion,
Thou didst bleed.

Risen Lord, in glory seated,
We are one with Thee;
Thou hast snapt the chains that bound us,
We are free.

Gratefully we Thee remember
As we break the bread,
Symbol of Thy body given
In our stead.

Drink we too "the cup of blessing"
Which Thy love has filled;
Through Thy blood we have redemption
Fears are stilled.

Backward look we, drawn to Calv'ry,
Musing while we sing;
Forward haste we to Thy coming,
Lord and King!--------230
Lord Jesus, in Thy precious name,
And in that name alone;
At Thy request we gladly meet,
Thy Lordship here would own.

As on that dark betrayal night,
Thou didst this feast ordain;
We too, the bread and cup would take,
Thy death, Lord, thus proclaim.

The bread, Thy body doth portray;
The cup, Thy precious blood;
By which our sin was put away,
Our peace was made with God.

The Host art Thou, Our blessed Lord,
Thy honored guests are we;
With grateful and adoring hearts
We would remember Thee!

Lord Jesus, whom unseen we love,
As thus we muse on Thee;
We none would see, save Thee alone,
Thou Man of Calvary!--------231
Amidst us our Beloved stands,
And bids us view His piercd hands;
Points to the wounded feet and side,
Blest emblems of the Crucified.

What food luxurious loads the board
When, at His table, sits the Lord!
The wine how rich, the bread how sweet,
When Jesus deigns the guests to meet!

If now, with eyes defiled and dim,
We see the signs, but see not Him;
Oh, may His love the scales displace,
And bid us see Him face to face!

Thou glorious Bridegroom of our hearts,
Thy present smile Thy grace imparts!
Oh, lift the veil, if veil there be,
Let every saint Thy glory see!--------232
By Christ redeemed, in Christ restored,
We keep the memory adored,
And show the death of our dear Lord
Until He come.

His body broken in our stead
Is seen in this memorial bread,
And so our feeble love is fed
Until He come.

The drops of His dread agony,
His life-blood shed for us, we see;
The wine shall tell the mystery
Until He come.

And thus that dark betrayal-night
With the last advent we unite,
By one blest chain of loving rite,
Until He come.

Until the trump of God be heard,
Until the ancient graves be stirred,
And with the great commanding word
The Lord shall come.

O blessed hope! with this elate;
Let not our heart be desolate,
But, strong in faith, in patience wait
Until He come.--------233
O what a miracle, my Lord,
That I'm in Thee and Thou in me,
That Thou and I are really one;
O what a wondrous mystery!

For me Thy body Thou didst give,
That I may ever share in Thee;
For me Thy precious blood was shed,
That from my sins I might be free.

By resurrection Thou didst change
Thy form and as the Spirit come;
Thou wouldst that I be filled with Thee
That all Thy riches mine become.

Now as the symbols we behold,
Thy loving self we see anew;
We thank Thee for Thy heart's desire
As all Thy travail we review.

We eat the bread and drink the wine,
And to Thy sweetness we are led;
In spirit each receiving Thee,
Our spirits with Thyself are fed.

We long to eat and drink e'en more,
To take Thyself in spirit thus,
Till Thou shalt all our being fill
And true remembrance have from us.--------234
Who is He in yonder stall,
At whose feet the shepherds fall?

'Tis the Lord! oh wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!
At His feet we humbly fall,
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!

Who is He in deep distress,
Fasting in the wilderness?

'Tis the Lord! oh wondrous story!
'Tis the Lord! the King of glory!
At His feet we humbly fall,
Crown Him! crown Him, Lord of all!

Who is He the people bless

At the grave where Lazarus sleeps?

Greet with loud triumphant song?

Prays in dark Gethsemane?

Dies in grief and agony?

Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Sing, ye saints! His wonderful love proclaim!
Hail Him! hail Him! mightiest angels in glory;
Strength and honor give to His holy name!
Like a shepherd, Jesus will feed His people,
In His arms He carries them all day long;
O ye saints that live in the light of His presence,
Praise Him! praise Him! ever in joyful song!

Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
For our sins He suffered and bled and died;
He, our Rock, our Hope of eternal salvation,
Hail Him! hail Him! Jesus, the Crucified;
Loving Savior, meekly enduring sorrow,
Crowned with thorns that cruelly pierced His brow;
Once for us rejected, despised, and forsaken,
Prince of Glory, ever triumphant now.

Praise Him! praise Him! Jesus, our blessed Redeemer!
Heavenly portals, loud with hosannahs ring!
Jesus, Savior, reigneth for ever and ever;
Crown Him! crown Him! Prophet and Priest and King!
Death is vanquished! Tell it with joy, ye faithful,
Where is now thy victory, boasting grave?
Jesus lives! No longer thy portals are cheerless;
Jesus lives, the mighty and strong to save.--------236
Lamb of God! our souls adore Thee,
While upon Thy face we gaze;
There the Father's love and glory
Shine in all their brightest rays;
Thine Almighty pow'r and wisdom
All creation's works proclaim;
Heav'n and earth alike confess Thee
As the ever great "I AM."

Lamb of God! Thy Father's bosom
Ever was Thy dwelling place;
His delight, in Him rejoicing,
One with Him in pow'r and grace;
O what wondrous love and mercy!
Thou didst lay Thy glory by;
And for us didst come from heaven
As the Lamb of God to die.

Lamb of God! When we behold Thee
Lowly in the manger laid,
Wand'ring as a homeless stranger
In the world Thy hands had made;
When we see Thee in the garden
In Thine agony of blood,
At Thy grace we are confounded,
Holy, spotless Lamb of God!

When we see Thee, as the victim,
Bound to the accursd tree,
For our guilt and folly stricken,
All our judgment borne by Thee,
Lord, we own, with hearts adoring,
Thou hast loved us unto blood;
Glory, glory everlasting
Be to Thee, Thou Lamb of God.

Lamb of God, Thou soon in glory
Wilt to this sad earth return;
All Thy foes shall quake before Thee,
All that now despise Thee mourn;
Then Thy saints all gathered to Thee,
With Thee in Thy kingdom reign;
Thine the praise and Thine the glory,
Lamb of God, for sinners slain!--------237
Amazing words!  He 'gave Himself for me,'
For me  rebellious, sinful, guilty me.
For me the Savior bore the cross and shame;
Rejoice, my soul, and bless His sacred name.

For me He left His glorious throne above,
For me revealed His Father's wondrous love,
For me He tabernacled here below,
For me He drank the bitter cup of woe.

For me He was reviled, despised, betrayed;
For me was scourged, condemned and crucified;
For me He suffered on th' accursd tree
For me  lost, wretched, vile, unworthy me.

For me in agony He groaned and died,
For me God's righteous law He satisfied,
For me His precious blood He shed to save,
For me He rose triumphant from the grave.--------238
When morning gilds the skies,
My heart awaking cries:
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Alike at work and prayer
To Jesus I repair:
May Jesus Christ be praised!

To Thee, my God above,
I cry with glowing love,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The fairest graces spring
In hearts that ever sing,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

Does sadness fill my mind?
A solace here I find,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Or fades my earthly bliss?
My comfort still is this,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

When evil thoughts molest,
With this I shield my breast,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The powers of darkness fear,
When this sweet chant they hear,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

When sleep her balm denies,
My silent spirit sighs,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
The night becomes as day,
When from the heart we say,
May Jesus Christ be praised!

Be this, while life is mine,
My canticle divine,
May Jesus Christ be praised!
Be this th' eternal song
Through all the ages long,
May Jesus Christ be praised!--------239
Ten thousand thanks to Jesus,

And glory be Thine,
And glory be Thine.
Blessing and honor and glory be Thine,
Both now and evermore.--------242
The Spirit of God today
The Spirit of Jesus is,
The God-man who died and rose,
Ascending to glory His.

'Tis from such a Jesus came
The Spirit of Jesus to us,
To make His reality
Experience unto us.

The Spirit of Jesus has
All elements human, divine,
The living of man in Him
And glory of God combine.

The suff'ring of human life,
Effectiveness of His death,
His rising and reigning too
Are all in the Spirit's breath.

With all these components true
His Spirit in us doth move,
And by His anointing full
The riches of Christ we prove.

This Spirit of Jesus doth
Encompass both great and small;
Inclusively He doth work
In us, making God our all.--------243
God's Spirit is of Christ today,
The Spirit of reality,
He dwells in me with Christ as life
To make this Christ so real to me.

As Christ is God's embodiment,
Expressing God as life divine;
So is the Spirit unto Christ,
Revealing Him in life sublime.

The fulness of the Father God
In Christ the Son dwells bodily;
And all the riches of the Son
Are Spirit, our reality.

Oh in the Son the Father is,
And now the Spirit is the Son;
The Father with the Son is joined,
The Spirit with the Son is one.

'Tis when the Spirit strengthens us
And Christ His home makes in our hearts,
The Father's fulness with His love
Will fill us in our inward parts.

In Christ, the Father we possess,
Receiving Him for all our need;
In Spirit we experience Christ
As life and everything indeed.

With Thy divine reality,
Lord, fill us by Thy Spirit now,
That we may all be full of Thee,
And all Thy riches thus avow.--------244
The Holy Spirit is today
The Spirit of the life divine,
He quickens us and gives us life,
And makes us fit for God's design.

As living water quenching thirst
The stream of life He e'er supplies;
Imparting Christ as life divine,
My hungry heart He satisfies.

Enlight'ning with the light of life,
He chases darkness far away;
Imparting Christ as light divine,
He turns for us the night to day.

He strengthens with the pow'r of life
To energize our inner man;
Imparting Christ as strength divine,
He moves within us for God's plan.

By law of life He liberates,
And frees us from the law of sin;
And with the nature all divine
He regulates us from within.

As Spirit of the life divine,
Thru us abundant fruit He bears;
Expressing God-like attributes,
To others Christ in life He shares.

The Spirit ever giving life
Transforms me thus with life divine;
Renewing all my inward parts,
In life He makes Christ's image mine.

Oh, by Thy Spirit, fill me, Lord,
The Spirit of Thy life divine,
And saturate me thoroughly
Till all my life is filled with Thine.--------245
Oh, spread the tidings 'round, wherever man is found,
Wherever human hearts and human woes abound;
Let every Christian tongue proclaim the joyful sound:
The Comforter has come!

  The Comforter has come,
  The Comforter has come!
  The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
  The Lord's dear promise giv'n;
  Oh, spread the tidings 'round,
  Wherever man is found

And hushed the dreadful wail and fury of the blast,
As o'er the golden hills the day advances fast!

  The Comforter has come,
  The Comforter has come!
  The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
  The Lord's dear promise giv'n;
  Oh, spread the tidings 'round,
  Wherever man is found

To every captive soul a full deliv'rance brings;
And through the vacant cells the song of triumph rings:
The Comforter has come!

  The Comforter has come,
  The Comforter has come!
  The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
  The Lord's dear promise giv'n;
  Oh, spread the tidings 'round,
  Wherever man is found
  The Comforter has come!

O boundless love divine! How shall this tongue of mine
To wond'ring mortals tell the matchless grace divine
That I, a child of hell, should in His image shine!
The Comforter has come!

  The Comforter has come,
  The Comforter has come!
  The Holy Ghost from heav'n,
  The Lord's dear promise giv'n;
  Oh, spread the tidings 'round,
  Wherever man is found
  The Comforter has come!--------246
Joys are flowing like a river,
Since the Comforter has come;
He abides with us forever,
Makes the trusting heart His home.

  Blessed quietness, holy quietness
  What assurance in my soul!
  On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
  How the billows cease to roll!

Bringing life and health and gladness
All around, this heavenly Guest
Banished unbelief and sadness,
Changed our weariness to rest.

  Blessed quietness, holy quietness
  What assurance in my soul!
  On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
  How the billows cease to roll!

Like the rain that falls from heaven,
Like the sunlight from the sky,
So the Holy Ghost is given,
Coming to us from on high.

  Blessed quietness, holy quietness
  What assurance in my soul!
  On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
  How the billows cease to roll!

See a fruitful field is growing
Blessed fruits of righteousness,
And the streams of life are flowing
In the lonely wilderness.

  Blessed quietness, holy quietness
  What assurance in my soul!
  On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
  How the billows cease to roll!

What a wonderful salvation
Where we always see His face!
What a perfect habitation!
What a quiet resting place!

  Blessed quietness, holy quietness
  What assurance in my soul!
  On the stormy sea He speaks peace to me.
  How the billows cease to roll!--------247
Our blest Redeemer ere He breathed
His tender last farewell,
A guide, a comforter, bequeathed
With us to dwell.

He came sweet influence to impart,
A gracious, willing guest,
While He can find one humble heart
Wherein to rest.

And His that gentle voice we hear,
Soft as the breath of even,
That checks each fault, that calms each fear
With peace of heav'n.

And every virtue we possess,
And every victory won,
And every thought of holiness,
Are His alone.

Lord, in Thy purity and grace,
Our weakness pitying see;
Oh, make our heart Thy dwelling place,
And worthier Thee.--------248
Fainting in the desert,
Israel's thousands stand
At the rock of Kadesh.
Hark! the Lord's command,
Speak to the Rock,
Bid the waters flow,
Strike not its bosom
Opened long ago,
Speak to the Rock,
Till the waters flow.

  Speak to the Rock,
  Bid the waters flow,
  Doubt not the Spirit,
  Given long ago;
  Take what He waiteth,
  Freely to bestow,
  Drink till its fulness
  All Thy being know.

Blessed Rock of Ages,
Thou art open still;
Thy blest Holy Spirit
All our being fill;
Still Thou dost say,
Wherefore struggle so?
Call for the Spirit,
Whisper soft and low,
Speak to the Rock
Bid the waters flow.

  Speak to the Rock,
  Bid the waters flow,
  Doubt not the Spirit,
  Given long ago;
  Take what He waiteth,
  Freely to bestow,
  Drink till its fulness
  All Thy being know.

Oh, for trust more simple,
Fully to believe;
Oh, for hearts more childlike,
Freely to receive;
E'en as a babe,
On its mother's breast,
So on Thy bosom
Let my spirit rest,
Filled with Thy life,
With Thy blessing blest.

  Speak to the Rock,
  Bid the waters flow,
  Doubt not the Spirit,
  Given long ago;
  Take what He waiteth,
  Freely to bestow,
  Drink till its fulness
  All Thy being know.--------249
Flow through me, Lord, a weak and earthly vessel,
Cleansed by Thy blood, and quickened at Thy call.
Flow through me, Lord, all utterly abandoned,
To Thy dear service, great, or high, or small.

Flow through me, Lord, with overflowing fulness,
Make me to know Thine own deep love for souls.
Work in me, Lord, the faith that moveth mountains,
As power, Almighty power, my being holds.

Flow through me, Lord, till sin in all its blackness
To captives bound by Satan is revealed.
Flow through me, Lord, till hearts are stricken, broken,
And in Thy cleansing fountain saved and healed.

Flow through me, Lord, till lagging souls are quickened,
Till lives of failure sing the victory song,
Till praise from lips long dumb and silent, open,
And join with rapture earth's glad, cleansd throng.

Flow through me, Lord, till waters from Thy fountain
Shall slake the thirst of souls in deserts drear.
Flow through me, Lord, till arid places blossom
With roses fresh and sweet, and wondrous fair.

Flow through me, Lord, set all my heart-strings thrilling,
With Thine own love, so matchless, perfect, free.
Flow through me, Lord, till naught in earth or heaven,
Can satisfy my being, Lord, but Thee.--------250
Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers
That Thy stream flow through me.

Christ, the Rock, is riven;
Living water's flowing;
But within my heart now
It is blocked from going.

I will dig by praying,
Dig the dirt entirely,
Thus release the Spirit,
Let the stream flow freely.

There's no need again that
Christ, the Rock, be riven,
But unto the digging
That I should be given.

What I need most deeply
Is the Spirit's filling,
That the living water
From my heart be welling.

Dig till there is nothing
Left to block the passage;
Dig until the stream flows
With the living message.

Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers
That Thy stream flow through me.--------251
Rivers of living water,
Rivers that flow from the throne,
Rivers o'erflowing with blessing,
Coming from Jesus alone.

  Rivers of living water,
  Rivers of life so free,
  Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
  Send now the rivers through me.

Whoso is thirsty come hither,
Here is abundant supply;
Water transparent as crystal,
Come without money and buy.

  Rivers of living water,
  Rivers of life so free,
  Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
  Send now the rivers through me.

Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,
Make me a channel today;
Empty me, fill me and use me,
Teach me to trust and obey.

  Rivers of living water,
  Rivers of life so free,
  Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
  Send now the rivers through me.

Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
Through me the rivers can flow;
Thus and thus only will others
Learn Thy great fulness to know.

  Rivers of living water,
  Rivers of life so free,
  Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
  Send now the rivers through me.

Now I surrender to Jesus,
Here I lay all at His feet;
Anything, anywhere only,
Just for His service made meet!

  Rivers of living water,
  Rivers of life so free,
  Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
  Send now the rivers through me.--------252
Thou Breath from still eternity
Breathe o'er my spirit's barren land
The pine tree and the myrtle tree
Shall spring amid the desert sand;
And where Thy living water flows
The waste shall blossom as the rose.

May I in will and deed and word
Obey Thee as a little child;
And keep me in Thy love, my Lord,
For ever holy, undefiled;
Within me teach, and strive, and pray,
Lest I should choose my own wild way.

Thy Spirit, Stream by Thee, the Son,
Is opened to us crystal pure,
Forth flowing from the heavenly throne
To waiting hearts and spirits poor;
Athirst and weary do I sink
Beside Thy waters, there to drink.

My spirit turns to Thee and clings,
All else forsaking, unto Thee;
Forgetting all created things,
Remembering only "God in me."
Thy living Stream, Thy gracious Rain,
None wait for these, and wait in vain.--------253
Breathe on us, Lord of life,
Fill us with life anew,
That we may love what Thou dost love,
And do what Thou wouldst do.

Breathe on us, Lord of life,
Until our hearts are pure,
Until with Thee we will one will,
To do or to endure.

Breathe on us, Lord of life,
Till we are wholly Thine,
Till all this earthly part of us
Glows with Thy fire divine.

Breathe on us, Lord of life,
So shall we never die,
But live with Thee the perfect life
Of Thine eternity.--------254
O Lord of life, breathe on us now,
And move within us while we pray;
The spring of our new life art Thou,
The very light of our new day.

O strangely art Thou with us, Lord,
Neither in height nor depth to seek;
In nearness shall Thy voice be heard;
Spirit to spirit Thou dost speak.

Thou art our Advocate on high;
He is our Advocate within;
O plead the truth, and make reply
To every argument of sin.

But ah, this faithless heart of mine!
The way I know, I know my guide;
Forgive me, O my Friend divine,
That I so often turn aside.

Be with me when no other friend
The myst'ry of my heart can share;
And be Thou known, when fears transcend,
By Thy best name of Comforter.--------255
O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,
Teach me how to breathe Thee in;
Help me pour into Thy bosom
All my life of self and sin.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

I am breathing out my own life,
That I may be filled with Thine;
Letting go my strength and weakness,
Breathing in Thy life divine.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

Breathing out my sinful nature,
Thou hast borne it all for me;
Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,
Finding all my life in Thee.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

I am breathing out my sorrow,
On Thy kind and gentle breast;
Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,
Breathing in Thy peace and rest.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

I am breathing out my sickness,
Thou hast borne its burden too;
I am breathing in Thy healing,
Ever promised, ever new.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

I am breathing out my longings
In Thy listening, loving ear;
I am breathing in Thy answers,
Stilling every doubt and fear.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.

I am breathing every moment,
Drawing all my life from Thee;
Breath by breath I live upon Thee,
Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.

  I am breathing out my sorrow,
  Breathing out my sin;
  I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
  All Thy fulness in.--------256

Upon us here today!
With stirring and reviving might,
To us Thy pow'r display.

And all the barriers break;.

  Oh, may Thy Spirit blow!
  With power cause us to transcend,
  Grant us the living flow!--------258
"With one accord" within an upper room
The faithful followers of Jesus met:
One was the hope of every waiting soul,
And on one object great each heart was set.

"With one accord," until the mighty gift
Of pentecostal power was outpoured;
Then forth as witnesses possessed of God,
To preach the resurrection of the Lord!

"With one accord" within the house of God
A hallelujah song is daily raised,
As with the voice of one, from vocal hearts
Christ Jesus' name is glorified and praised.

Pour down Thy Spirit once again, dear Lord;
Our cry goes up to Thee for "latter rain";
Unite Thy people as the "heart of one,"
And pentecostal days shall come again!--------259
Lord, I hear of show'rs of blessing
Thou art scatt'ring full and free,
Show'rs the thirsty land refreshing;
Let some drops now fall on me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.

Pass me not, O gracious Father!
Sinful though my heart may be;
Thou might'st leave me, but the rather
Let Thy mercy fall on me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.

Pass me not, O tender Savior!
Let me love and cling to Thee;
I am longing for Thy favor;
While Thou'rt calling, call for me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.

Pass me not, O Lord, the Spirit!
Thou canst make the blind to see;
By the Witness of Thy merit,
Speak the word of power to me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.

Love of God, so pure and changeless!
Blood of Christ, so rich and free!
Grace of God, so strong and boundless!
Magnify them all in me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.

Pass me not! Thy lost one bringing,
Bind my heart, O Lord, to Thee;
While the streams of life are springing,
Blessing others, oh, bless me.

  Even me, even me,
  Let some drops now fall on me.--------260
There shall be showers of blessing:
This is the promise of love;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
Sent from the Savior above.

  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing
Precious reviving again;
Over the hills and the valleys,
Sound of abundance of rain.

  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing;
Send them upon us, O Lord!
Grant to us now a refreshing;
Come, and now honor Thy Word.

  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing;
O that today they might fall,
Now as to God we're confessing,
Now as on Jesus we call!

  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.

There shall be showers of blessing,
If we but trust and obey;
There shall be seasons refreshing,
If we let God have His way.

  Showers of blessing,
  Showers of blessing we need;
  Mercy-drops round us are falling,
  But for the showers we plead.--------261
Praise waiteth Thee in mercy's court,
Where Thy beloved dwell;
Ransomed, released from Satan's thrall,
Their Hallelujahs swell.
Come, as the Spirit, Lord, today,
Our songs of praise inspire;
Purge the iniquity, and touch
Our lips with living fire.

Praise for what Thou our God hast wrought;
For promised blessings ours;
The cloud on faith's horizon seen,
The pentecostal showers.
Praise for Thine own right way, dear Lord,
We did not understand,
But as Thy plans unfolded lie,
We see Thy guiding hand.

Enlarge our soul's capacity,
Cut deeper channels, Lord;
Room for the floods of blessing now,
According to Thy Word.
E'en while we praise, the heavens rend,
In power come from on high;
Make this another Pentecost,
Answer our spirit's cry.--------262
Come, Lord, as the Spirit come,
Lo! we stretch our hands to Thee;
From the Father to the Son,
Let us now Thy glory see.

  Come, oh Lord, Great Spirit, come!
  Let the mighty deed be done!
  Satisfy our soul's desire,
  See us waiting for the fire,
  Waiting, waiting,
  See us waiting for the fire.

On the altar now we lay
Soul and body, mind and will;
All the evil passions slay,
Come, and every corner fill.

Now the sacrifice we make,
Though as dear as a right eye,
For our blessed Savior's sake,
Who for us did bleed and die.

Now, by faith, the gift I claim,
Bought for me by blood divine:
Through the all-prevailing Name
All the promises are mine.--------263
God sent His mighty pow'r
To this poor, sinful heart,
To keep me every hour,
And needful grace impart;
And since His Spirit came,
To take supreme control,
The love-enkindled flame
Is burning in my soul.

'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul.

Before the cross I bow,
Upon the altar lay
A willing off'ring now,
My all from day to day.
My Savior paid the price,
My name He sweetly calls;
Upon the sacrifice
The fire from heaven falls.

'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul.

No good that I have done,
His promise I embrace;
Accepted in the Son,
He saves me by His grace.
All glory be to God!
Let hallelujahs roll;
His love is shed abroad,
The fire is in my soul.

'Tis burning in my soul,
'Tis burning in my soul;
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul;
The Holy Spirit came,
All glory to His name!
The fire of heav'nly love is
burning in my soul.--------264
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love
Shed in my soul abroad;
Then shall my heart no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God,
Rooted and fixed in God.

Oh, that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow;
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow,
And make the mountains flow.

He, who at Pentecost didst fall,
May He my sins consume;
Thy Holy Ghost, for Him I call;
Thy burning Spirit, come,
Thy burning Spirit, come.

Refining fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole,
And sanctify the whole.

My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move,
While Christ is all the world to me,
And all my heart is love,
And all my heart is love.--------265
Where the sprinkling of the blood is,
There the ointment doth remain;
Man in touch with God thus bringing,
These the fellowship maintain.

Blood, the emblem of redemption,
Cleansing all the sins away;
Ointment, symbol of the Spirit,
Bringing God to man for aye.

Blood doth speak of what God worketh,
Ointment, what He is for us;
By His work and by His person
God Himself is blent with us.

By the blood of Christ's redemption
We are cleansed from all alloy;
By th' anointing of the Spirit
God Himself we may enjoy.

By the cleansing and anointing
We with God are kept in one;
By the blood and by the ointment
God, our portion full, is won.

We in faith must claim the cleansing
When we need the precious blood,
Ever to obey th' anointing,
Thus to live and walk with God.

God as light we'll then be knowing,
God experience as love,
And in God as life e'er growing,
God as power we will prove.--------266
Divine anointing in me dwelleth,
And it teaches me all things;
It ever leads me in the Lord to live
And to me His presence brings.

  In my spirit the anointing dwells,
  O the anointing dwells and teaches everything;
  In my spirit the anointing dwells
  And ever teaches everything.

It is the moving of the Spirit
Gracious as the ointment pure;
'Tis based upon the sprinkling of the blood,
And it ever shall endure.

  In my spirit the anointing dwells,
  O the anointing dwells and teaches everything;
  In my spirit the anointing dwells
  And ever teaches everything.

With God's own essence it anoints me,
God to know subjectively,
That I may have His very element
Fully saturating me.

  In my spirit the anointing dwells,
  O the anointing dwells and teaches everything;
  In my spirit the anointing dwells
  And ever teaches everything.

'Tis by this inner life-anointing
I in fellowship may move;
In God, the light of truth, I'm walking,
And the love of grace I prove.

  In my spirit the anointing dwells,
  O the anointing dwells and teaches everything;
  In my spirit the anointing dwells
  And ever teaches everything.--------267
Fill me with Thy gracious Spirit,
Fill my longing spirit now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!

  Fill me now! Fill me now!
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
  Strip me wholly, empty throughly,
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!

Thou can'st fill me with Thy Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!

  Fill me now! Fill me now!
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
  Strip me wholly, empty throughly,
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!

I am weakness, full of weakness;
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
By Thy blest, eternal Spirit,
Fill with strength, and fill me now!

  Fill me now! Fill me now!
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
  Strip me wholly, empty throughly,
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!

Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
Fill my broken spirit now!
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.

  Fill me now! Fill me now!
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
  Strip me wholly, empty throughly,
  Fill me with Thy Spirit now!--------268
How I praise Thee, precious Savior,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,
That I might Thy channel be.

  Channels only, blessed Master,
  But with all Thy wondrous grace,
  Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
  Every hour in every place.

Just a channel, full of blessing,
To the thirsty hearts around;
To tell out Thy full salvation,
All Thy loving message sound.

  Channels only, blessed Master,
  But with all Thy wondrous grace,
  Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
  Every hour in every place.

Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
A clean vessel in Thine hand;
With no strength but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

  Channels only, blessed Master,
  But with all Thy wondrous grace,
  Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
  Every hour in every place.

Witnessing Thy grace to save me,
Setting free from self and sin;
Thou hast bought me to possess me,
In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.

  Channels only, blessed Master,
  But with all Thy wondrous grace,
  Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
  Every hour in every place.

O Lord, fill now with Thy Spirit
Hearts that full surrender know;
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow.

  Channels only, blessed Master,
  But with all Thy wondrous grace,
  Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
  Every hour in every place.--------269
O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Let my life Thy channel be,
Just a channel, Lord, for Thee;
Through me all Thy riches pour,
Give me ever more and more.

O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Be it unto me, O Lord,
Now, according to Thy word;
Let the life of Jesus be,
Ever filling, even me.

O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
Cleansed and holy, pure and clean,
Let the life of Christ be seen;
Hold o'er me Thy gracious sway,
Every hour of every day.

O Lord, with Thy Holy Ghost,
Fill me to the uttermost;
For Thy love, Thy light, Thy grace,
Just a channel all my days;
Till my Savior's face I see,
Fill me, Lord, fill even me.--------270
Lord, in Thy Spirit, take and fill my heart;
Wean it from earth, through all its pulses move;
Into my spirit all Thy grace impart,
And make me love Thee as I ought to love.

I ask no dream, no prophet ecstasies,
No sudden rending of the veil of clay,
No angel visitant, no opening skies;
But take the dimness of my soul away.

Hast Thou not bid us love Thee, God and King?
All, all Thine own  soul, heart and strength and mind.
I see Thy cross  there teach my heart to cling.
Oh, let me seek Thee, and, oh, let me find.

Teach me to feel that Thou art always nigh;
Teach me the struggles of the soul to bear,
To check the rising doubt, the rebel sigh;
Teach me the patience of unanswered prayer.

Teach me to love Thee with a virgin love,
One holy passion filling all my frame;
Thus all the riches of Thyself to prove,
My heart an altar, and Thy love the flame.--------271
Of the Spirit born in spirit,
As the sons of God indeed,
We possess the Holy Spirit,
Dwelling in us for all need.
Yet we still need more of Him, Lord,
That we may be full of Thee;
May Thou fill us with Thy Spirit,
Give us life abundantly.

Lord, we know the Spirit in us,
But of life Thy Spirit is,
That the riches of Thy fulness
We may share thru what He is.
Yet we still require Thy Spirit
As the power from on high,
That for all Thy work and service,
We may be equipped thereby.

Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit,
Clothe us with Thy pow'r of might;
With this "mantle" of Thy power,
We may then the battle fight.
May Thy wind now blow upon us,
Giving us the tongues of fire,
That, as witnesses anointed,
We'll fulfill Thy heart's desire.

With the power of Thy Spirit,
Still we need the gifts to share,
That as members we may function
And Thy testimony bear.
By Thy Spirit's full outpouring,
Lord, impart the gifts we need,
That the building of Thy Body
With Thy blessing might proceed.

For Thy glory and Thy kingdom,
May Thou hear Thy Body's cry!
Now fulfill Thy holy purpose,
All our hunger satisfy.
May we all partake Thy Spirit,
Him apply in many ways;
His infilling, His outpouring,
And His gifts to share always.--------272
Christ indeed was born of Spirit
When He came a man to be;
And before His service started,
With the Spirit filled was He.
Yet He still received the baptism
Of the Spirit from on high
When He came to start His service
And was clothed with pow'r thereby.

Peter and the Lord's disciples
All were Spirit born and filled,
Breathing in the Holy Spirit
As on them Christ breathed and willed.
Yet they still received the baptism
Of the Spirit from on high
When they were equipped for service,
And were clothed with pow'r thereby.

Saul of Tarsus, the Ephesians,
And Samaritans believed;
Thus by Spirit generated,
Of His fulness they received.
Yet they still received the baptism
Of the Spirit from on high
When some laid their hands upon them,
And were clothed with pow'r thereby.

We are also born of Spirit
On the day when we believe,
And of Him we now are drinking
As we daily Him receive.
Yet we also must be baptized
With the Spirit from on high,
Thus to be equipped for service,
And be clothed with pow'r thereby.

Lord, baptize us with Thy Spirit!
This is what we need today;
Clothe us with Thy heav'nly power,
Bring us under its full sway.
Oh, baptize us in this hour!
This is all our earnest cry;
Now on us repeat Thine answer,
Clothe with power from on high.--------273
Lord, we come to Thee, and with liberty
Claim we now from Thee pow'r of might;
For Thy kingdom's sake, may we pow'r partake,
Sitting in the heavenlies to fight.

  Power! power! clothe us with Thy power!
  With Thy mighty power from on high!
  Power! power! clothe us with Thy power!
  Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!

Lord, we look to Thee and with certainty
Claim we now from Thee show'r divine,
For Thy Body's sake, may we show'r partake,
Thus be fitted for the work of Thine.

  Shower! shower! pour on us Thy shower!
  Pour Thy heav'nly shower from on high!
  Shower! shower! pour on us Thy shower!
  Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!

Lord, we wait on Thee, and with surety
Claim we now from Thee fire divine.
For Thy gospel's sake, may we fire partake,
That the people's heart Thou may refine.

  Fire! fire! give us tongues of fire!
  To proclaim Thy message from on high!
  Fire! fire! give us tongues of fire!
  Boldly, as Thy Body, now we cry!--------274
O Lord, we seek the power we need;
We are so weak in word and in deed
And in Thy service cannot proceed,
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!

  We are waiting, and to Thee we bow,
  In Thy presence all our need avow;
  Give us Thy power, give even now,
  Clothe us with pow'r today.

Lord, come and visit us at this place,
Grant to Thy Church the gifts of Thy grace,
Fully with might our service embrace,
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!

  We are waiting, and to Thee we bow,
  In Thy presence all our need avow;
  Give us Thy power, give even now,
  Clothe us with pow'r today.

Send us Thy power with its full sway,
As Thou didst send on Pentecost day;
Answer our prayer and make no delay,
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!

  We are waiting, and to Thee we bow,
  In Thy presence all our need avow;
  Give us Thy power, give even now,
  Clothe us with pow'r today.

Here, as Thy Body, Thy pow'r we claim;
Claiming by faith in Thy mighty Name,
Thy heav'nly show'r with Thy heav'nly flame;
Clothe us with pow'r we pray!

  We are waiting, and to Thee we bow,
  In Thy presence all our need avow;
  Give us Thy power, give even now,
  Clothe us with pow'r today.--------275
Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone
Can meet our need today;
His might alone empow'ring us
Can bring us neath Thy sway.

  Thy Spirit of pow'r with might,
  Send in our midst, we pray,
  And come upon each seeking soul;
  Baptize us with power today.

Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, alone
Can grant us Thy desire;
His power alone can turn our heart
And light the sacred fire.

  Thy Spirit of pow'r with might,
  Send in our midst, we pray,
  And come upon each seeking soul;
  Baptize us with power today.

Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can give
The gifts we seek to share;
His pow'r can signs and wonders work
And stir up holy fear.

  Thy Spirit of pow'r with might,
  Send in our midst, we pray,
  And come upon each seeking soul;
  Baptize us with power today.

Thy Holy Spirit, Lord, can bring
The show'r we need this hour;
And while we seek, Lord Jesus, come
In motivating power.

  Thy Spirit of pow'r with might,
  Send in our midst, we pray,
  And like a rushing, mighty wind
  Sweep over our souls today.--------276
What a blessed fact! What a tiding glad!
In the Spirit we have been baptized;
Take this settled fact, nothing need we add,
In the Spirit we have been baptized.

Take it! take it!
Take now this fact by living faith;
Take it! take it!
Take now this accomplished fact by faith.

In the testament it is clearly told,
In the Spirit we have been baptized;
It is so complete, we need only hold,
In the Spirit we have been baptized.

Hold it! hold it!
Hold now this fact by living faith;
Hold it! hold it!
Hold now this accomplished fact by faith.

Christ upon the Church hath His Spirit poured,
In the Spirit we have been baptized;
Share her portion now, share in full accord,
In the Spirit we have been baptized.

Share it! share it!
Share now this fact by living faith;
Share it! share it!
Share now this accomplished fact by faith.

With the Body right, on the Body ground,
Move and act on this accomplished fact;
Sins and doubts condemn, wait no more around,
But by living faith now move and act.

Act now! act now!
Act on this fact by living faith;
Act now! act now!
Act on this accomplished fact by faith.--------277
Christ the Savior hath ascended
To the heavens far above,
Crowned with glory and with honor
By the Father God in love;
He hath made Him Head of all things,
His supremacy to prove.

From this Christ to God ascended
Hath the Spirit been outpoured,
Poured upon the Church, His Body,
That His members be empow'red;
Thus the Lord of all in heaven
Thru His Church will be adored.

In the flesh by incarnation,
Into man He God hath brought;
By His death and resurrection,
Into God He man hath brought;
God and man together mingled,
In Himself is fully wrought.

Now in heaven by ascension
He is seated on the throne;
All the lordship, all the headship,
He Himself doth fully own;
And by pouring out His Spirit,
He as such might be made known.

By this outpour, His descension
On the Church was realized;
'Tis by this, that in His Spirit
All the Church He hath baptized;
Thus the baptism of the Spirit
Was forever actualized.

Hallelujah, 'tis accomplished,
And accomplished once for all!
Hallelujah, we're included,
All included, great or small!
Praise Him, He hath sent the Spirit
And baptized the Church withal!--------278
The Spirit of life is within us today,
Who's likened to water our thirst to allay;
Of Him we may drink and be filled thus with Him,
Until as a river He flows from within.

The Spirit of pow'r comes upon us today,
Who's likened to clothing ourselves to array;
In Him we are baptized, with Him we are dressed,
For service equipping with power possessed.

The Spirit of life is as breath glorious,
As spirit of life it is breathed into us;
The Spirit of pow'r doth the wind typify,
Which bloweth upon us with pow'r from on high.

Into His disciples the risen Lord breathed,
The Spirit of life thus to them He bequeathed;
Th' ascended Lord poured at the Pentecost hour
Upon His disciples the Spirit of pow'r.

The Spirit of life is within as the life,
The Spirit of power is giv'n for this life;
As blowing of wind brings the fresh air to breathe,
The Spirit of power to life doth bequeath.

These are not two spirits apart and afar,
But of the one Spirit the two functions are,
To clothe us with God and to fill us within,
That we may be thoroughly mingled with Him.

Lord, fill with Thy Spirit of life every part,
That we may grow up in Thy life as Thou art;
And clothe us without with Thy Spirit of pow'r
Thy will to fulfill in Thy service each hour.--------279
First the blood, and then the ointment,
Cleansing, then anointing comes;
If we pass not thru Golgotha,
Ne'er to Pentecost we'll come.
If the blood has never cleansed us,
Ne'er the Spirit's pow'r we'll know,
If for Christ we'd truly witness,
Self-life to the Cross must go.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.

Christ, the Rock, must first be smitten,
That the living water flow;
Without death the Spirit's fulness
Ne'er could dwell in man below.
If with Christ we die completely,
Willing thus our all to lose,
He will clothe us with His power
And to win the world will use.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.

First the altar, then the fire,
If no loss, there'll be no gain;
If our all has not been offered,
To the throne we'll ne'er attain.
If to sacrifice we're willing,
All forsaking, God t'obey,
He to us will be committed
And thru us His pow'r display.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.

First we must prepare the vessels
That the Oil they may contain;
Dig the valley full of ditches
That they may be filled with Rain.
First we must go thru the Jordan
Ere anointed from above;
First in death we must be baptized,
Then experience the Dove.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.

When we see the ripened harvest
Of the golden countryside,
We may know that many seeds have
Fallen to the earth and died.
Ere the fruit of life may blossom,
We must surely suffer death;
If with Christ we've not been buried,
We'll not feel the Spirit's breath.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.

Since it must be thus, I pray, Lord,
Help me go the narrow way;
Deal with pride and make me willing
Thus to suffer, Thee t'obey.
I for greater power pray not,
Deeper death is what I need;
All the meaning of the Cross, Lord,
Work in me  for this I plead.

  Through the Cross, O Lord, I pray,
  Put my soul-life all away;
  Make me any price to pay,
  Full anointing to receive.--------280
Lord, may Thy blood now cleanse me,
Wash all my sins away,
That with Thy Holy Spirit
Thou may anoint, I pray.
My service, I confess, Lord,
Is failure-full and weak;
The filling of Thy Spirit
To live for Thee I seek.

  Oh, from myself deliver,
  From all its misery;
  I'd henceforth be forever
  Completely filled with Thee.

Oh, Lord, how dry my heart is,
It yearns and pants for Thee;
The filling of Thy Spirit
Is now my fervent plea.
Within the smitten Rock, Lord,
I would entirely hide;
Pour thru Thy living water,
Till I am satisfied.

  Oh, from myself deliver,
  From all its misery;
  I'd henceforth be forever
  Completely filled with Thee.

How cold my heart has been, Lord,
How slow obeying Thee;
So fill me with Thy Spirit,
I'll ne'er rebellious be.
I lie upon Thy altar
And dare not move away;
Oh, may Thy flame descending
Consume my all, I pray.

  Oh, from myself deliver,
  From all its misery;
  I'd henceforth be forever
  Completely filled with Thee.

Oh, may Thy Cross within me
Deepen its work and burn,
In me enlarge Thy measure,
And me to ashes turn.
Oh, may Thy Spirit fill me
Each day more than before,
And may Thy living water
On me and thru me pour.

  Oh, from myself deliver,
  From all its misery;
  I'd henceforth be forever
  Completely filled with Thee.--------281
  Repeat the last line of each verse

Lord, the Spirit, Truth divine,
Dawn upon this heart of mine;
Word of God, and inward light,
Wake my spirit, clear my sight.

Lord, the Spirit, Love divine,
Glow within this heart of mine,
Kindle every high desire,
Perish self in Thy pure fire.

Lord, the Spirit, Power divine,
Fill and nerve this will of mine;
By Thee may I strongly live,
Bravely bear, and nobly strive.

Lord, the Spirit, Peace divine,
Still this restless heart of mine,
Speak to calm this tossing sea,
Stayed in Thy tranquility.

Lord, the Spirit, Joy divine,
Gladden Thou this heart of mine;
In the desert ways I'll sing:
Spring, O Well, forever spring!--------282
Lord of light, with light divine,
Shine upon this heart of mine;
Chase the shades of night away,
Turn the darkness into day.

Lord of power, with power divine,
Cleanse this guilty heart of mine;
Long has sin without control
Held dominion o'er my soul.

Lord of joy, with joy divine,
Cheer this saddened heart of mine;
Bid my many woes depart,
Heal my wounded, bleeding heart.

Lord, the Spirit, all divine,
Dwell within this heart of mine;
Cast down every idol throne,
Reign supreme, and reign alone.--------283
Lord, Thou knowest all the hunger
Of the heart that seeks Thee now;
How my soul hath long been craving
What Thou only canst bestow.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

Failure in my walk and witness,
Failure in my work I see;
Fruitless toil, un-Christlike living,
Calling forth no praise to Thee.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

Now to Thee my soul confesses
All its failure, all its sin;
All the pride, the self-contentment,
All the "secret faults" within.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

Save me from myself, my Father,
From each subtle form of pride;
Lead me now with Christ to Calvary,
Show me I with Him have died.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

No more let it be my working,
Nor my wisdom, love, or power,
But the life of Jesus only,
Passing through me hour by hour.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

Let the fulness of Thy Spirit
Resting on Him cover me,
That the witness borne to others.
May bring glory, Lord, to Thee.

  Seeking now, seeking now,
  Let Thy Spirit meet me now.

Father, in Thy Son's Name, pleading,
I believe my prayer is heard;
And I praise Thee for the answer,
Resting simply on Thy word.

  Praising now, praising now,
  Thou hast answered, Lord, I know.--------284
Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know;
Spirit, breathing from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so.
Oh, this full and perfect peace!
Oh, this transport all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine.

Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green;
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen:
Birds with gladder songs o'erflow,
Flow'rs with deeper beauties shine,
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His, and He is mine.

Things that once were wild alarms
Cannot now disturb my rest;
Closed in everlasting arms,
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh, to lie forever here,
Doubt and care and self resign,
While He whispers in my ear,
I am His, and He is mine.

His forever, only His:
Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart.
Heaven and earth may fade and flee,
Firstborn light in gloom decline;
But, while God and I shall be,
I am His, and He is mine.--------285
Come and rejoice with me!
For once my heart was poor,
And I have found a treasury
Of love, a boundless store.

Come and rejoice with me!
I, once so sick at heart,
Have met with One who knows my case,
And knows the healing art.

Come and rejoice with me!
For I was wearied sore,
And I have found a mighty arm
Which holds me evermore.

Come and rejoice with me!
My feet so wide did roam,
And One has brought me from afar,
To find in Him my home.

Come and rejoice with me!
For I have found a Friend
Who knows my heart's most secret depths,
Yet loves me without end.

I knew not of His love;
And He had loved so long,
With love so faithful and so deep,
So tender and so strong.

And now I know it all,
Have heard and known His voice,
And hear it still from day to day.
Can I enough rejoice?--------286
Of Jesus' love that sought me,
When I was lost in sin;
Of wondrous grace that brought me
Back to His fold again;
Of heights and depths of mercy,
Far deeper than the sea,
And higher than the heavens,
My theme shall ever be.

  Sweeter as the years go by,
  Sweeter as the years go by;
  Richer, fuller, deeper,
  Jesus' love is sweeter,
  Sweeter as the years go by.

He trod in old Judea
Life's pathway long ago;
The people thronged about Him,
His saving grace to know.
He healed the broken-hearted,
And caused the blind to see;
And still His great heart yearneth
In love for even me.

  Sweeter as the years go by,
  Sweeter as the years go by;
  Richer, fuller, deeper,
  Jesus' love is sweeter,
  Sweeter as the years go by.--------287
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Sweetest Name on earth,
How can I, a sinner,
Come to know its worth?

Oh! the sinful sorrow,
Oh! the strangest shame,
That I saw no beauty
In that sacred Name.

Never felt the sweetness!
Never knew the grace,
Never saw the love-pain
In that wounded face!

Never found the mystery
In that simple word
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
Savior, Lover, Lord.

Now 'tis past and over.
Gone my guilt and shame;
Jesus, Jesus did it,
Glory to His Name!

Wonderful compassion,
Reaching even me;
Bows my humbled spirit
In captivity.

Jesus! Jesus! Jesus!
Loved me in my shame.
Oh! the joy and rapture
Of that sacred Name.--------288
I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
He loved me ere I knew Him;
He drew me with the cords of love,
And thus He bound me to Him.
And round my heart still closely twine
Those ties which naught can sever,
For I am His, and He is mine,
Forever and forever.

I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
He bled, He died to save me;
And not alone the gift of life,
But His own self He gave me.
Naught that I have my own I call,
I hold it for the Giver;
My heart, my strength, my life, my all,
Are His, and His forever.

I've found a Friend, oh, such a Friend!
So kind, and true, and tender,
So wise a Counsellor and Guide,
So mighty a Defender!
From Him who loves me now so well,
What power my soul can sever?
Shall life or death, or earth or hell?
No, I am His forever.--------289
I stand all amazed at the love Jesus offers me,
Confused at the grace that so fully He proffers me;
I tremble to know that for me He was crucified,
That for me, a sinner, He suffered, He bled and died.

  O it is wonderful that He should care for me
  Enough to die for me!
  O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

I marvel that He would descend from His throne divine
To rescue a soul so rebellious and proud as mine;
That He should extend His great love unto such as I,
Sufficient to own, to redeem, and to justify.

  O it is wonderful that He should care for me
  Enough to die for me!
  O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!

I think of His side, pierced and bleeding to pay the debt,
Such mercy, such love and devotion can I forget?
No, no! I will praise and adore at the mercy seat,
And testify all my desires He doth fully meet.

  O it is wonderful that He should care for me
  Enough to die for me!
  O it is wonderful, wonderful to me!--------290
I stand amazed in the presence
Of Jesus the Nazarene,
And wonder how He could love me,
A sinner condemned, unclean.

  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior's love for me!

For me it was in the garden,
He prayed: "Not my will, but Thine."
He had no tears for His own griefs,
But sweat-drops of blood for mine.

  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior's love for me!

In pity angels beheld Him,
And came from the world of light
To strengthen Him in the sorrows
He bore for my soul that night.

  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior's love for me!

He took my sins and my sorrows,
He made them His very own;
He bore the burden to Calv'ry,
And suffered, and died alone.

  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior's love for me!

When with the ransomed in glory
His face I at last shall see,
'Twill be my joy through the ages
To sing of His love for me.

  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  And my song shall ever be:
  How marvelous! How wonderful!
  Is my Savior's love for me!--------291
I am so glad that our Father in heav'n
Tells of His love in the Book He has giv'n;
Wonderful things in the Bible I see:
This is the dearest, that Jesus loves me.

  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves even me.

Though I forget Him and wander away,
Still He doth love me whenever I stray;
Back to His dear loving arms would I flee,
When I remember that Jesus loves me.

  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves even me.

Oh, if there's only one song I can sing,
When in His beauty I see the great King,
This shall my song in eternity be:
"Oh, what a wonder that Jesus loves me."

  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves me, Jesus loves me;
  I am so glad that Jesus loves me,
  Jesus loves even me.--------292
A debtor to mercy alone,
Of covenant mercy I sing,
Nor fear, with God's righteousness on,
My person and off'rings to bring.
The terrors of law and of God
With me can have nothing to do;
My Savior's obedience and blood
Hide all my transgressions from view.

The work which His goodness began,
The arm of His strength will complete;
His promise is Yea and Amen,
And never was forfeited yet.
Things future, nor things that are now,
Not all things below or above,
Can make Him His purpose forego,
Or sever my soul from His love.

My name from the palms of His hands
Eternity will not erase;
Imprest on His heart, it remains
In marks of indelible grace.
Yes! I to the end shall endure,
As sure as the earnest is giv'n;
More happy, but not more secure,
When all earthly ties have been riv'n.--------293
Cleansed in our Savior's precious Blood,
Filled with the fulness of our God,
Walking by faith the path He trod,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Leaning our heads on Jesus' breast,
Knowing the joy of that sweet rest,
Finding in Him the chief, the best,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Kept by His pow'r from day to day,
Held by His hand, we cannot stray,
Glory to glory all the way,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

Living in us His own pure life,
Giving us rest from inward strife,
From strength to strength, from death to life,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!

O what a Savior we have found;
Well may we make the world resound
With one continual joyous sound,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!--------294
Gone from my heart the world and all its charms;
Now through the blood I'm saved from all alarms;
Down at the cross my heart is bending low;
The precious blood of Jesus cleanses white as snow.

  I love Him, I love Him,
  Because He first loved me,
  And purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.

Once I was lost, and fallen deep in sin;
Once was a slave to passions fierce within;
Once was afraid to meet an angry God,
But now I'm cleansed from every stain thro' Jesus' blood.

  I love Him, I love Him,
  Because He first loved me,
  And purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.

Once I was bound, but now I am set free;
Once I was blind, but now the light I see;
Once I was dead, but now in Christ I live,
To tell the world around the peace that He doth give.

  I love Him, I love Him,
  Because He first loved me,
  And purchased my salvation on Calv'ry's tree.--------295
God's Christ, who is my righteousness,
My beauty is, my glorious dress;
Midst flaming worlds, in this arrayed,
With joy shall I lift up my head.

Lord, I believe Thy precious blood,
Which, at the mercy seat of God,
Forever doth for sinners plead,
For me, e'en for my soul, was shed.

Lord, I believe were sinners more
Than sands upon the ocean shore,
Thou hast for all a ransom paid,
For all a full redemption made.

Bold can I stand in every way,
For who aught to my charge shall lay?
Fully, by Thee, absolved I am
From sin and fear, from guilt and shame.

This spotless robe the same appears,
When ruined nature sinks in years;
No age can change its glorious hue,
Its glory is forever new.

Thou God of power, Thou God of love,
Let all Thy saints Thy mercy prove;
Our beauty this, our glorious dress,
Jesus the Lord, our Righteousness.--------296
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

And can it be that I should gain
An int'rest in the Savior's blood?
Died He for me, who caused His pain?
For me, who Him to death pursued?
Amazing love! how can it be
That Thou, my God, shouldst die for me?

'Tis mystery all! The Immortal dies!
Who can explore His strange design?
In vain the firstborn seraph tries
To sound the depths of love Divine!
'Tis mercy all! let earth adore,
Let angel minds inquire no more.

He left His Father's throne above,
So free, so infinite His grace;
Emptied Himself of all but love,
And bled for Adam's helpless race:
'Tis mercy all, immense and free;
For, O my God, it found out me.

Long my imprisoned spirit lay
Fast bound in sin and nature's night;
Thine eye diffused a quickening ray,
I woke, the dungeon flamed with light;
My chains fell off, my heart was free,
I rose, went forth, and followed Thee.

No condemnation now I dread;
Jesus, and all in Him, is mine!
Alive in Him, my living Head,
And clothed in righteousness Divine,
Bold I approach the eternal throne,
And claim the crown, through Christ my own.--------297
"No condemnation!" precious word!
Consider it, my soul!
Thy sins were all on Jesus laid,
His stripes have made thee whole.

In God's own presence now for us
The Savior doth appear;
The saints, as jewels on His heart,
Jesus doth ever bear.

"No condemnation!" O my soul,
'Tis God that speaks the word;
Perfect in comeliness art thou
In Christ, the risen Lord.

Teach me, O God, to fix mine eyes
On Christ, the spotless Lamb,
So shall I love Thy precious will,
And glorify His name.--------298
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus' name.

  On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
  All other ground is sinking sand,
  All other ground is sinking sand.

When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

  On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
  All other ground is sinking sand,
  All other ground is sinking sand.

His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

  On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
  All other ground is sinking sand,
  All other ground is sinking sand.

When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
In Him, my righteousness, alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.

  On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
  All other ground is sinking sand,
  All other ground is sinking sand.--------299
A mind at perfect peace with God;
O what a word is this!
A sinner reconciled through blood;
This, this indeed is peace.

By nature and by practice far,
How very far from God,
Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,
Through faith in Jesus' blood.

So nigh, so very nigh to God,
I cannot nearer be;
For in the person of His Son
I am as near as He.

So dear, so very dear to God,
More dear I cannot be;
The love wherewith He loves the Son,
Such is His love to me.

Why should I ever anxious be,
Since such a God is mine?
He watches o'er me night and day,
And tells me "Mine is thine."--------300
Arise, my soul, arise!
Shake off thy guilty fears;
The bleeding Sacrifice
In my behalf appears.
Before the throne my Surety stands;
My name is written on His hands.

He ever lives above
For me to intercede,
His all-redeeming love,
His precious blood to plead.
His blood was shed for all our race,
And sprinkles now the throne of grace.

Five bleeding wounds He bears,
Received on Calvary;
They pour effectual prayers;
They strongly speak for me.
Forgive him, O forgive, they cry,
Nor let that ransomed sinner die!

The Father hears Him pray,
His dear anointed One;
He cannot turn away
The presence of His Son.
His Spirit answers to the blood,
And tells me I am born of God.

To God I'm reconciled,
His pardoning voice I hear;
He owns me for His child,
I can no longer fear.
With confidence I now draw nigh,
And Father, Abba, Father, cry.--------301
Redeemed  how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.

  Redeemed, redeemed,
  Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
  Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.

Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

  Redeemed, redeemed,
  Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
  Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.

I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

  Redeemed, redeemed,
  Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
  Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.

I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps,
And giveth me songs in the night.

  Redeemed, redeemed,
  Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
  Redeemed, redeemed,
  His child, and forever, I am.--------302
I have a song I love to sing,
Since I have been redeemed,
Of my Redeemer, Savior, King
Since I have been redeemed.

  Since I have been redeemed,
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in His name;
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in the Savior's name.

I have a Christ that satisfies,
Since I have been redeemed,
To do His will my highest prize
Since I have been redeemed.

  Since I have been redeemed,
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in His name;
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in the Savior's name.

I have a witness bright and clear,
Since I have been redeemed,
Dispelling every doubt and fear
Since I have been redeemed.

  Since I have been redeemed,
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in His name;
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in the Savior's name.

I have a joy I can't express,
Since I have been redeemed,
All through the Lord, my righteousness
Since I have been redeemed.

  Since I have been redeemed,
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in His name;
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in the Savior's name.

I have a God who is for me,
Since I have been redeemed,
With whom I'll dwell eternally
Since I have been redeemed.

  Since I have been redeemed,
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in His name;
  Since I have been redeemed,
  I will glory in the Savior's name.--------303
Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
No riches of earth could have saved my poor soul.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior now maketh me whole.

  I am redeemed, but not with silver;
  I am bought, but not with gold;
  Bought with a price  the blood of Jesus,
  Precious price of love untold.

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The guilt on my conscience too heavy had grown.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior I only can own.

  I am redeemed, but not with silver;
  I am bought, but not with gold;
  Bought with a price  the blood of Jesus,
  Precious price of love untold.

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The holy commandment forbade me draw near.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior removeth my fear.

  I am redeemed, but not with silver;
  I am bought, but not with gold;
  Bought with a price  the blood of Jesus,
  Precious price of love untold.

Nor silver nor gold hath obtained my redemption;
The way to God's kingdom could not thus be bought.
The blood of the cross is my only foundation;
The death of my Savior redemption hath wrought.

  I am redeemed, but not with silver;
  I am bought, but not with gold;
  Bought with a price  the blood of Jesus,
  Precious price of love untold.--------304
How should the Lord keep back His sword from blood?
"The soul that sinneth it shall surely die:"
But ah, can Justice make His counsels good?
Can Law bring in the glory from on high?
Grace must provide a Lamb  a Ransom find;
Redeem by One whom death no more may bind.

"One poor wise man" hath cried, O God, to Thee;
His blood is counted precious in Thy sight.
He liveth, and His name shall ever be
Thy praise, Thy glory, Thy supreme delight.
By Jesus' blood  that new and living way
God's priests shall now within the holiest stay.

The blood of bulls and goats for ages failed
To purge the conscience, burdened sore with sins;
Thy precious blood, O Lamb of God, prevailed
Through Thee, sweet Peace her endless reign begins.
Thy blood hath made redemption e'en for me;
Complete I stand, O risen Christ, in Thee.

The precious blood of Christ, it speaketh peace
To guilty sinners, groaning 'neath their load;
To captive spirits it proclaims release,
And Pharaoh's slaves become the "hosts of God."
His flesh is meat  His blood is drink indeed;
He died, He rose, His people's cause to plead.

Oh, precious blood! Poured freely forth for me,
My sins are sunk beneath thy crimson tide.
No more before th' Avenger's sword I flee!
Christ is the Refuge-City, where I hide.
My life's dark page, blood-sprinkled, gleameth white;
My name shines forth in heaven in words of light.--------305
I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His wondrous love to me;
On the cruel cross He suffered,
From the curse to set me free.

  Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
  With His blood He purchased me,
  On the cross He sealed my pardon,
  Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will tell the wondrous story,
How my lost estate to save,
In His boundless love and mercy,
He the ransom freely gave.

  Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
  With His blood He purchased me,
  On the cross He sealed my pardon,
  Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will praise my dear Redeemer,
His triumphant pow'r I'll tell,
How the victory He giveth
Over sin, and death, and hell.

  Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
  With His blood He purchased me,
  On the cross He sealed my pardon,
  Paid the debt, and made me free.

I will sing of my Redeemer,
And His heav'nly love to me;
He from death to life hath brought me,
Son of God with Him to be.

  Sing, oh, sing of my Redeemer,
  With His blood He purchased me,
  On the cross He sealed my pardon,
  Paid the debt, and made me free.--------306
I belong to Jesus;
I am not my own;
All I have and all I am
Shall be His alone.

I belong to Jesus;
He is Lord and King,
Reigning in my inmost heart
Over everything.

I belong to Jesus;
What can hurt or harm,
When He folds around my soul
His almighty Arm?

I belong to Jesus;
Blessed, blessed thought!
With His own most precious blood
Has my soul been bought.

I belong to Jesus;
He has died for me;
I am His and He is mine
Through eternity.

I belong to Jesus;
He will keep my soul,
If the deathly waters dark
Round about me roll.

I belong to Jesus;
And ere long I'll be
With my precious Savior there
In His royalty.--------307
On Calvary's brow my Savior died
'Twas there my Lord was crucified;
'Twas on the cross He bled for me,
And purchased there my pardon free.

  O Calvary! Dark Calvary!
  Where Jesus shed His blood for me;
  O Calvary! Blest Calvary!
  'Twas there my Savior died for me.

'Mid rending rocks and darkening skies
My Savior bows His head and dies;
The opening veil reveals the way
To life divine and endless day.

  O Calvary! Dark Calvary!
  Where Jesus shed His blood for me;
  O Calvary! Blest Calvary!
  'Twas there my Savior died for me.

O Jesus, Lord, how can it be
That Thou shouldst give Thy life for me,
To bear the cross and agony
In that dread hour on Calvary!

  O Calvary! Dark Calvary!
  Where Jesus shed His blood for me;
  O Calvary! Blest Calvary!
  'Twas there my Savior died for me.--------308
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.

  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.
  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.

Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.
  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.

Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blest;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.
  This is my story, this is my song,
  Praising my Savior all the day long.--------309
What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I have ceased from my wand'ring and going astray,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And my sins which were many are all washed away,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I'm possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

There's a light in the valley of death now for me,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And I'm happy, so happy as onward I go,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

Since Jesus came into my heart!
Since Jesus came into my heart!
Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!--------310
Once I was bound by sin's galling fetters,
Chained like a slave I struggled in vain;
But I received a glorious freedom,
When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.

  Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
  No more in chains of sin I repine!
  Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
  Now and forever He shall be mine.

Freedom from all the carnal affections,
Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions,
Freedom from all that saddened my life.

  Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
  No more in chains of sin I repine!
  Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
  Now and forever He shall be mine.

Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
Freedom from evil temper and anger,
Glorious freedom, rapture untold.

  Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
  No more in chains of sin I repine!
  Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
  Now and forever He shall be mine.

Freedom from fear with all of its torments,
Freedom from care with all of its pain;
Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,
He who has rent my fetters in twain.

  Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
  No more in chains of sin I repine!
  Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
  Now and forever He shall be mine.--------311
Naught have I gotten but what I received;
Grace hath bestowed it since I have believed;
Boasting excluded, pride I abase;
I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  This is my story, to God be the glory,
  I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

Once I was foolish, and sin ruled my heart,
Causing my footsteps from God to depart;
Jesus hath found me, happy my case;
I now am a sinner saved by grace!

  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  This is my story, to God be the glory,
  I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

Tears unavailing, no merit had I;
Mercy had saved me, or else I must die;
Sin had alarmed me, fearing God's face;
But now I'm a sinner saved by grace!

  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  This is my story, to God be the glory,
  I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

Suffer a sinner whose heart overflows,
Loving his Savior to tell what he knows;
Once more to tell it, would I embrace
I'm only a sinner saved by grace!

  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  Only a sinner saved by grace!
  This is my story, to God be the glory,
  I'm only a sinner saved by grace!--------312
Grace! 'Tis a charming sound.
Harmonious to the ear;
Heav'n with the echo shall resound,
And all the earth shall hear.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.

'Twas grace that wrote my name
In life's eternal book;
'Twas grace that gave me to the Lamb,
Who all my sorrows took.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.

Grace taught my wandering feet
To tread the pilgrim road;
And new supplies each hour I meet
While pressing on to God.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.

Grace taught my heart to pray,
And made my eyes o'erflow;
'Tis grace which kept me to this day,
And will not let me go.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.

Grace all the work shall crown
Through everlasting days;
It lays in love the topmost stone,
And well deserves the praise.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.

Oh, let that grace inspire
My heart with strength divine;
May all my powers to Thee aspire,
And all my days be Thine.

  All sufficient grace!
  Never powerless!
  It is Christ who lives in me,
  In His exhaustlessness.--------313
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

The Lord hath promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

When we've been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We've no less days to sing God's praise
Than when we first begun.--------314
Sov'reign grace o'er sin abounding,
Ransomed souls, the tidings swell;
'Tis a deep that knows no sounding,
Who its breadth or length can tell?
On its glories, on its glories,
Let my soul forever dwell!
On its glories, on its glories,
Let my soul forever dwell!

What from Christ the soul can sever,
Bound by everlasting bands?
Once in Him, in Him forever,
Thus th' eternal cov'nant stands.
None shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee
From the Savior's mighty hands!
None shall pluck thee, none shall pluck thee
From the Savior's mighty hands!

Heirs of God, joint-heirs with Jesus,
Long ere time its race begun;
To His name eternal praises,
O what wonders love has done!
One with Jesus, one with Jesus,
By eternal union one.
One with Jesus, one with Jesus,
By eternal union one.

On such love, my soul, still ponder,
Love, so great, so rich, so free;
Say, while lost in holy wonder,
Why, O Lord, such love to me?
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Grace shall reign eternally!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Grace shall reign eternally!--------315
Saved to the uttermost, I am the Lord's;
Jesus my Savior salvation affords;
Gives me His Spirit a witness within,
Whisp'ring of pardon, and saving from sin.

  Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
  Saved, saved by power divine;
  Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
  Jesus the Savior is mine!

Saved to the uttermost; Jesus is near;
Keeping me safely, He casteth out fear;
Trusting His promises, how I am blest;
Leaning upon Him, how sweet is my rest.

  Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
  Saved, saved by power divine;
  Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
  Jesus the Savior is mine!

Saved to the uttermost: this I can say,
"Once all was darkness, but now it is day."
Beautiful visions of glory I see;
Jesus in brightness revealed unto me.

  Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
  Saved, saved by power divine;
  Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
  Jesus the Savior is mine!

Saved to the uttermost: cheerfully sing
Loud hallelujahs to Jesus my King!
Ransomed and pardoned, redeemed by His blood,
Cleansed from unrighteousness, glory to God!

  Saved, saved, saved to the uttermost:
  Saved, saved by power divine;
  Saved, saved, I'm saved to the uttermost;
  Jesus the Savior is mine!--------316
Some day the silver cord will break,
And I no more as now shall sing;
But, O the joy when I shall wake
Within the presence of the King!

  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace:
  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace.

Some day my earthly house will fall,
I cannot tell how soon 'twill be,
But this I know  my All in all
Has now a place with Him for me.

  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace:
  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace.

Or some day when my Lord will come,
And called to meet Him I'll be blest,
He then will say to me, "Well done,"
And I shall enter into rest.

  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace:
  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace.

Some day, till then I'll watch and wait,
My lamp all trimmed and burning bright,
That when my Savior I will greet,
My faith will then be changed to sight.

  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace:
  And I shall see Him face to face,
  And tell the story, saved by grace.--------317
Dear Savior, Thou art mine,
How sweet the thought to me;
Let me repeat Thy name,
And lift my heart to Thee.

  Mine! Mine! Mine!
  I know Thou art mine;
  Savior, dear Savior,
  I know thou art mine.

Thou art the sinner's friend,
So I Thy friendship claim,
A sinner saved by grace,
When thy sweet message came.

  Mine! Mine! Mine!
  I know Thou art mine;
  Savior, dear Savior,
  I know thou art mine.

My hardened heart was touched;
Thy pard'ning voice I heard;
And joy and peace came in
While list'ning to Thy word.

  Mine! Mine! Mine!
  I know Thou art mine;
  Savior, dear Savior,
  I know thou art mine.

So let me sing Thy praise,
So let me call Thee mine.
I cannot doubt Thy word,
I know that I am Thine.

  Mine! Mine! Mine!
  I know Thou art mine;
  Savior, dear Savior,
  I know thou art mine.--------318
Precious Savior, Thou hast saved me;
Thine, and only Thine, I am:
Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
Glory, glory to the Lamb!

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!

Long my yearning heart was striving
To obtain this precious rest;
But, when all my struggles ended,
Simply trusting, I was blessed.

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!

Trusting, trusting every moment;
Feeling now the blood applied;
Lying in the cleansing fountain,
Dwelling in my Savior's side.

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!

Consecrated to Thy service,
I will live and die to Thee;
I will witness to Thy glory,
Of salvation, full and free.

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!

Yes, I will stand up for Jesus,
He has sweetly saved my soul,
Cleansed my soul from sin's corruption,
Sanctified, and made me whole.

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!

Glory to the Lord who bought me,
Glory for His saving power;
Glory to the Lord who keeps me,
Glory, glory evermore!

  Glory, glory, hallelujah!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!
  Oh, the cleansing blood has reached me!
  Glory, glory to the Lamb!--------319
Come, Thou Fount of every blessing,
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace;
Streams of mercy, never ceasing,
Call for songs of loudest praise.
Jesus sought me when a stranger,
Wand'ring from the face of God;
He, to save my soul from danger,
Interposed His precious blood.

O to grace how great a debtor
Daily I'm constrained to be!
Let that grace, Lord, like a fetter,
Bind my wand'ring heart to Thee.
Teach me, Lord, some rapturous measure,
Meet for me Thy grace to prove,
While I sing the countless treasure
Of my God's unchanging love.

Prone to wander, Lord, I feel it;
Prone to leave the God I love:
Take my heart, oh, take and seal it
With Thy Spirit from above.
Rescued thus from sin and danger,
Purchased by the Savior's blood,
May I walk on earth a stranger,
As a son and heir of God.--------320
In loving-kindness Jesus came
My soul in mercy to reclaim,
And from the depths of sin and shame
Through grace He lifted me.

  From sinking sand He lifted me,
  With tender hand He lifted me,
  From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!

He called me long before I heard,
Before my sinful heart was stirred,
But when I took Him at His word,
Forgiv'n, He lifted me.

  From sinking sand He lifted me,
  With tender hand He lifted me,
  From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!

His brow was pierced with many a thorn,
His hands by cruel nails were torn,
When from my guilt and grief, forlorn,
In love He lifted me.

  From sinking sand He lifted me,
  With tender hand He lifted me,
  From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!

Now on a higher plane I dwell,
And with my soul I know 'tis well;
Yet how or why, I cannot tell,
He should have lifted me.

  From sinking sand He lifted me,
  With tender hand He lifted me,
  From shades of night to plains of light,
  Oh, praise His name, He lifted me!--------321
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Lo, the fountain opened wide,
Streams through every land and nation
From the Savior's wounded side.
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Streams an endless crimson tide.

Oh, the glorious revelation!
See the cleansing current flow,
Washing stains of condemnation
Whiter than the driven snow:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Oh, the rapturous bliss to know.

Love's resistless current sweeping
All the regions deep within;
Thought, and wish, and senses keeping
Now, and every instant, clean:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
From the guilt and power of sin.

Life immortal, Christ descending,
Lo! My heart the Spirit's shrine:
God and man in oneness blending,
Oh, what fellowship is mine!
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Raised in Christ to life divine!

Care and doubting, gloom and sorrow,
Fear and shame are mine no more;
Faith knows naught of dark tomorrow,
For my Savior goes before:
Full salvation! Full salvation!
Full and free for evermore!--------322
Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
One that never would run dry;
Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
Nothing seemed to satisfy.

  Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
  Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
  Finding joy and pleasure
  In abounding measure
  I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
For I find a living Spring,
And my cup of gladness now is running o'er,
Jesus is my Lord and King.

  Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
  Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
  Finding joy and pleasure
  In abounding measure
  I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

Here is sweet contentment as the days go by,
Here is holy peace and rest;
Here is consolation as the moments fly,
Here my heart is always blest.

  Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
  Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
  Finding joy and pleasure
  In abounding measure
  I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

Here I find a never ending, sure supply,
While the endless ages roll;
To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
There to bathe my weary soul.

  Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
  Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
  Finding joy and pleasure
  In abounding measure
  I am drinking at the Fountain of life.--------323
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Come unto Me, and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast."
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"Behold, I freely give
The living water: thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live."
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

I heard the voice of Jesus say,
"I am this dark world's Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright."
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that Light of life I'll walk
Till trav'lling days are done.--------324
  Can also sing "Beulah Land" as "Christ our Land".

Far away the noise of strife upon my ear is falling,
Then I know the sins of earth beset on every hand;
Doubt and fear and things of earth in vain to me are calling,
None of these shall move me from Beulah Land.

  I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
  I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
  O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
  For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

Far below the storm of doubt upon the world is beating,
Sons of men in battle long the enemy withstand;
Safe am I within the castle of God's word retreating,
Nothing then can reach me, 'tis Beulah Land.

  I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
  I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
  O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
  For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

Let the stormy breezes blow, their cry cannot alarm me,
I am safely sheltered here, protected by God's hand;
Here the sun is always shining, here there's naught can harm me,
I am safe forever in Beulah Land.

  I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
  I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
  O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
  For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.

Viewing here the works of God, I sink in contemplation,
Hearing now His blessed voice, I see the way is planned;
Dwelling in the spirit, here I learn of full salvation,
Gladly will I tarry in Beulah Land.

  I'm living on the mountain, underneath a cloudless sky,
  I'm drinking at the fountain that never shall run dry;
  O yes, I'm feasting on the manna from a bountiful supply,
  For I am dwelling in Beulah Land.--------325
All my life long I had panted
For a draught from some cool spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.

  Hallelujah! I have found Him
  Whom my soul so long has craved!
  Jesus satisfies my longings;
  Through His life I now am saved.

Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.

  Hallelujah! I have found Him
  Whom my soul so long has craved!
  Jesus satisfies my longings;
  Through His life I now am saved.

Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soul's sad cry.

  Hallelujah! I have found Him
  Whom my soul so long has craved!
  Jesus satisfies my longings;
  Through His life I now am saved.

Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life, so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.

  Hallelujah! I have found Him
  Whom my soul so long has craved!
  Jesus satisfies my longings;
  Through His life I now am saved.--------326
He lives, the great Redeemer lives,
What joy the blest assurance gives!
And now, before His Father, God,
Pleads the full merits of His blood.

Repeated crimes awake our fears,
And Justice armed with frowns appears;
But in the Savior's lovely face
Sweet Mercy smiles, and all is peace.

Hence, then, ye black, despairing thoughts;
Above our fears, above our faults,
His mighty intercessions rise,
And guilt recedes, and terror dies.

In every dark, distressful hour,
When sin and Satan join their power,
Let this dear hope repel the dart,
That Jesus bears us on His heart.

Great Advocate, almighty Friend!
On Him our humble hopes depend;
Our cause can never, never fail,
For Jesus pleads, and must prevail.--------327
Before the throne of God above
I have a strong, a perfect plea;
A great High Priest, whose Name is Love,
Who ever lives and pleads for me.

My name is graven on His hands,
My name is written on His heart;
I know that while with God He stands
No tongue can bid me thence depart.

When Satan tempts me to despair,
And tells me of the guilt within,
Upward I look, and see Him there
Who made an end of all my sin.

Because the sinless Savior died,
My sinful soul is counted free;
For God, the Just, is satisfied
To look on Him and pardon me.

Behold Him there, the risen Lamb!
My perfect, spotless Righteousness,
The great unchangeable I AM,
The King of glory and of grace.

One with Himself, I cannot die;
My soul is purchased by His blood;
My life is hid with Christ on high,
With Christ, my Savior and my God.--------328
Complete in Thee! No work of mine
May take, dear Lord, the place of Thine;
Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
And I am now complete in Thee.

  Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
  And sanctified! Salvation wrought!
  Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
  And glorified, I too, shall be!

Complete in Thee  no more shall sin,
Thy grace hath conquered, reign within;
Thy voice shall bid the tempter flee,
And I shall stand complete in Thee.

  Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
  And sanctified! Salvation wrought!
  Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
  And glorified, I too, shall be!

Complete in Thee  each want supplied,
And no good thing to me denied;
Since Thou my portion, Lord, wilt be,
I ask no more, complete in Thee.

  Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
  And sanctified! Salvation wrought!
  Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
  And glorified, I too, shall be!

Dear Savior! When before Thy bar
All tribes and tongues assembled are,
Among Thy chosen will I be,
At Thy right hand  complete in Thee.

  Yea, justified! O blessed thought!
  And sanctified! Salvation wrought!
  Thy blood hath pardon bought for me,
  And glorified, I too, shall be!--------329
Blessed be God, our God,
Who gave for us His well-beloved Son,
The gift of gifts, all other gifts in one;
Blessed be God, our God!

What will He not bestow!
Who freely gave this mighty gift unbought,
Unmerited, unheeded, and unsought,
What will He not bestow?

He spard not His Son!
'Tis this that silences each rising fear,
'Tis this that bids the hard thought disappear;
He spard not His Son!

Who shall condemn us now?
Since Christ has died, and ris'n, and gone above,
For us to plead at the right hand of Love;
Who shall condemn us now?

'Tis God that justifies!
Who shall recall His pardon or His grace?
Or who the broken chain of guilt replace?
'Tis God that justifies!

The victory is ours!
For us in might came forth the mighty One;
For us He fought the fight, the triumph won:
The victory is ours!--------330
My faith has found a resting place,
Not in device nor creed;
I trust the Ever-living One,
His wounds for me shall plead.

  I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
  It is enough that Jesus died,
  And that He died for me.

Enough for me that Jesus saves,
This ends my fear and doubt;
A sinful soul I come to Him,
He'll never cast me out.

  I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
  It is enough that Jesus died,
  And that He died for me.

My heart is leaning on the Word,
The written Word of God,
Salvation by my Savior's name,
Salvation through His blood.

  I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
  It is enough that Jesus died,
  And that He died for me.

My great Physician heals the sick,
The lost He came to save;
For me His precious blood He shed,
For me His life He gave.

  I need no other argument,
  I need no other plea;
  It is enough that Jesus died,
  And that He died for me.--------331
Will your anchor hold in the storms of life,
When the clouds unfold their wings of strife?
When the strong tides lift, and the cables strain,
Will your anchor drift or firm remain?

  We have an anchor that keeps the soul
  Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
  Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
  Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.

It is safely moored, 'twill the storm withstand,
For 'tis well secured by the Savior's hand;
And the cables passed from His heart to mine,
Can defy the blast, through strength divine.

  We have an anchor that keeps the soul
  Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
  Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
  Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.

It will firmly hold in the straits of fear,
When the breakers have told the reef is near;
Though the tempest rave and the wild winds blow,
Not an angry wave shall our bark o'erflow.

  We have an anchor that keeps the soul
  Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
  Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
  Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.

It will surely hold in the floods of death,
When the waters cold chill our latest breath;
On the rising tide it can never fail,
While our hopes abide within the veil.

  We have an anchor that keeps the soul
  Steadfast and sure while the billows roll,
  Fastened to the Rock which cannot move,
  Grounded firm and deep in the Savior's love.--------332
I hear the words of love,
I gaze upon the blood,
I see the mighty sacrifice,
And I have peace with God.

'Tis everlasting peace!
Sure as Jehovah's Name,
'Tis stable as His steadfast throne,
For evermore the same.

The clouds may go and come,
And storms may sweep my sky;
This blood-sealed friendship changes not,
The Cross is ever nigh.

My love is ofttimes low,
My joy still ebbs and flows,
But peace with Him remains the same,
No change my Savior knows.

I change, He changes not;
The Christ can never die;
His love, not mine, the resting-place,
His truth, not mine, the tie.

The Cross still stands unchanged,
Though heaven is now His home;
The mighty stone is rolled away,
But yonder is His tomb!

And yonder is my peace,
The grave of all my woes!
I know the Son of God has come,
I know He died and rose.

I know He liveth now
At God's right hand above;
I know the throne on which He sits,
I know His truth and love!--------333
I know not why God's wondrous grace
To me He hath made known,
Nor why, unworthy, Christ in love
Redeemed me for His own.

  But "I know Whom I have believd
  And am persuaded that He is able
  To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."

I know not how this saving faith
To me He did impart,
Nor how believing in His word
Wrought peace within my heart.

  But "I know Whom I have believd
  And am persuaded that He is able
  To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."

I know not how the Spirit moves,
Convincing men of sin,
Revealing Jesus through the Word,
Creating faith in Him.

  But "I know Whom I have believd
  And am persuaded that He is able
  To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."

I know not what of good or ill
May be reserved for me,
Of weary ways or golden days,
Before His face I see.

  But "I know Whom I have believd
  And am persuaded that He is able
  To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."

I know not when my Lord may come,
At night or noon-day fair,
Nor if I'll walk the vale with Him,
Or "meet Him in the air."

  But "I know Whom I have believd
  And am persuaded that He is able
  To keep that which I've committed
  Unto Him against that day."--------334
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
A wonderful Savior to me;
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
Where rivers of pleasure I see.

  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
  He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
  And covers me there with His hand,
  And covers me there with His hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
He taketh my burden away;
He holdeth me up and I shall not be moved.,
He giveth me strength as my day.

  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
  He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
  And covers me there with His hand,
  And covers me there with His hand.

With numberless blessings each moment He crowns,
And, filled with His fulness divine,
I sing in my rapture, oh, glory to God,
For such a Redeemer as mine!

  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
  He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
  And covers me there with His hand,
  And covers me there with His hand.

When clothed in His brightness, transported I rise
To meet Him in clouds of the sky,
His perfect salvation, His wonderful love,
I'll shout with the millions on high.

  He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
  That shadows a dry, thirsty land;
  He hideth my life in the depths of His love,
  And covers me there with His hand,
  And covers me there with His hand.--------335
I was lost in sin but Jesus rescued me,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
I was bound by fear but Jesus set me free,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.

  For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
  I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,

  He's a wonderful Savior to me.

He is always near to comfort and to cheer,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
He forgives my sins, He dries my every tear,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.

  For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
  I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.

Dearer grows the love of Jesus day by day,
He's a wonderful Savior to me;
Sweeter is His grace while pressing on my way,
He's a wonderful Savior to me.

  For He's a wonderful Savior to me,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me;
  I was lost in sin, but Jesus took me in,
  He's a wonderful Savior to me.--------336
Jesus has loved me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus has loved me, I cannot tell why;
Came He to rescue sinners all worthless;
My heart He conquered, for Him I would die.

  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore.

Jesus has saved me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus has saved me, I cannot tell how;
All that I know is He was my ransom,
Dying on Calv'ry with thorns on His brow.

  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore.

Jesus will lead me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus will lead me, I cannot tell where;
But I will follow, through joy or sorrow,
Sunshine or tempest, sweet peace or despair.

  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore.

Jesus will crown me, wonderful Savior!
Jesus will crown me, I cannot tell when;
His throne of splendor hail I with gladness,
Crowned with the glory of God among men.

  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, the One I adore;
  Glory to Jesus, wonderful Savior!
  Glory to Jesus, and praise evermore.--------337
I will sing the wondrous story
Of the Christ who died for me,
How He left His home in glory
For the cross of Calvary.

  Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
  Sing it in the light of glory,
  Sing it through eternity.

I was lost, but Jesus found me,
Found the sheep that went astray,
Threw His loving arms around me,
Drew me back into His way.

  Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
  Sing it in the light of glory,
  Sing it through eternity.

I was bruised, but Jesus healed me;
Faint was I from many a fall;
Sight was gone, and fears possessed me,
But He freed me from them all.

  Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
  Sing it in the light of glory,
  Sing it through eternity.

Days of darkness still come o'er me,
Sorrow's paths I often tread,
But the Savior still is with me;
By His hand I'm safely led.

  Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
  Sing it in the light of glory,
  Sing it through eternity.

He will keep me till the rapture,
Day by day He'll wash my feet,
And will transform all my nature
That in glory we may meet.

  Yes, I'll sing the wondrous story
  Of the Christ who died for me,
  Sing it in the light of glory,
  Sing it through eternity.--------338
Wounded for me, wounded for me,
There on the cross He was wounded for me;
Gone my transgressions, and now I am free,
All because Jesus was wounded for me.

Dying for me, dying for me,
There on the cross He was dying for me;
Now in His death my redemption I see,
All because Jesus was dying for me.

Risen for me, risen for me,
Up from the grave He has risen for me;
Now evermore from death's sting I am free,
All because Jesus has risen for me.

Living for me, living for me,
Up in the skies He is living for me;
Daily He's pleading and praying for me,
All because Jesus is living for me.

Coming for me, coming for me,
Soon in the air He is coming for me;
Then with what joy His dear face I shall see,
Oh, how I praise Him! He's coming for me.--------339
How firm a foundation, ye saints of the Lord,
Is laid for your faith in His excellent word!
What more can He say than to you He hath said,
To you who for refuge to Jesus have fled?

"Fear not, I am with thee, O be not dismayed,
For I am thy God, and will still give thee aid;
I'll strengthen thee, help thee, and cause thee to stand,
Upheld by My righteous, omnipotent hand.

"When through the deep waters I call thee to go,
The rivers of sorrow shall not overflow;
For I will be with thee, thy troubles to bless,
And sanctify to thee thy deepest distress.

"When through fiery trials thy pathway shall lie,
My grace, all sufficient, shall be thy supply;
The flame shall not hurt thee; I only design
Thy dross to consume, and thy gold to refine.

"E'en down to old age all My people shall prove
My sovereign, eternal, unchangeable love;
And then, when grey hairs shall their temples adorn,
Like lambs they shall still in My bosom be borne.

"The soul that on Jesus hath leaned for repose,
I will not, I will not desert to his foes;
That soul, though all hell should endeavor to shake,
I'll never, no, never, no, never forsake!"--------340
Standing on the promises of Christ my King,
Through eternal ages let His praises ring,
Glory in the highest, I will shout and sing,
Standing on the promises of God.

  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
  Standing, standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises that cannot fail,
When the howling storms of doubt and fear assail,
By the living Word of God I shall prevail,
Standing on the promises of God.

  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
  Standing, standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises I now can see
Perfect, present cleansing in the blood for me;
Standing in the liberty where Christ makes free,
Standing on the promises of God.

  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
  Standing, standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises of Christ the Lord,
Bound to Him eternally by love's strong cord,
Overcoming daily with the Spirit's sword,
Standing on the promises of God.

  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
  Standing, standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.

Standing on the promises I shall not fall,
List'ning every moment to the Spirit's call.
Resting in my Savior as my All in all,
Standing on the promises of God. ?

  Standing, standing,
  Standing on the promises of God my Savior;
  Standing, standing,
  I'm standing on the promises of God.--------341
When peace like a river attendeth my way,
When sorrows like sea billows roll;
Whatever my lot Thou hast taught me to say,
"It is well, it is well with my soul!"

  It is well with my soul!
  It is well, it is well with my soul!

Though Satan should buffet, though trials should come,
Let this blest assurance control,
That Christ hath regarded my helpless estate,
And hath shed His own blood for my soul.

  It is well with my soul!
  It is well, it is well with my soul!

My sin  oh, the bliss of this glorious thought
My sin, not in part, but the whole,
Is nailed to His Cross, and I bear it no more;
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord, O my soul!

  It is well with my soul!
  It is well, it is well with my soul!

For me, be it Christ, be it Christ hence to live;
If dark hours about me shall roll,
No pang shall be mine, for in death as in life
Thou wilt whisper Thy peace to my soul.

  It is well with my soul!
  It is well, it is well with my soul!--------342
Years I spent in vanity and pride,
Caring not my Lord was crucified,
Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary.

  Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
  Pardon there was multiplied to me;
  There my burdened soul found liberty,
  At Calvary.

By God's Word at last my sin I learned;
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned,
Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary.

  Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
  Pardon there was multiplied to me;
  There my burdened soul found liberty,
  At Calvary.

Now I've giv'n to Jesus everything,
Now I gladly own Him as my King,
Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary.

  Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
  Pardon there was multiplied to me;
  There my burdened soul found liberty,
  At Calvary.

Oh, the love that drew salvation's plan!
Oh, the grace that brought it down to man!
Oh, the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!

  Mercy there was great, and grace was free;
  Pardon there was multiplied to me;
  There my burdened soul found liberty,
  At Calvary.--------343
There is sunshine in my soul today,
More glorious and bright
Than glows in any earthly sky,
For Jesus is my light.

  O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
  While the peaceful, happy moments roll;
  When Jesus shows His smiling face
  There is sunshine in my soul.

There is music in my soul today,
A carol to my King;
And Jesus, listening, can hear
The song I cannot sing.

  O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
  While the peaceful, happy moments roll;
  When Jesus shows His smiling face
  There is sunshine in my soul.

There is springtime in my soul today,
For when the Lord is near
The dove of peace sings in my heart,
The flowers of grace appear.

  O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
  While the peaceful, happy moments roll;
  When Jesus shows His smiling face
  There is sunshine in my soul.

There is gladness in my soul today,
And hope, and praise, and love,
For blessings which He gives me now,
For joys laid up above.

  O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine,
  While the peaceful, happy moments roll;
  When Jesus shows His smiling face
  There is sunshine in my soul.--------344
Grace there is my every debt to pay,
Blood to wash my every sin away,
Pow'r to keep me spotless day by day,
In Christ for me.--------345
I wandered in the shades of night,
Till Jesus came to me,
And with the sunlight of His love
Bid all my darkness flee.

  Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,
  Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way,
  Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,
  I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Though clouds may gather in the sky,
And billows 'round me roll,
However dark the world may be,
I've sunlight in my soul.

  Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,
  Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way,
  Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,
  I have had the sunlight of His love within.

While walking in the light of God,
I sweet communion find;
I press with holy vigor on
And leave the world behind.

  Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,
  Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way,
  Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,
  I have had the sunlight of His love within.

Soon I shall see Him as He is,
The Light that came to me;
Behold the brightness of His face,
Throughout eternity.

  Sunlight, sunlight, in my soul today,
  Sunlight, sunlight, all along the way,
  Since the Savior found me, took away my sin,
  I have had the sunlight of His love within.--------346
I am not skilled to understand
What God hath willed, what God hath planned;
I only know at His right hand
Stands One who is my Savior.

I take Him at His word indeed:
"Christ died for sinners"  this I read;
For in my heart I find a need
Of Him to be my Savior!

That He should leave His place on high
And come for sinful man to die,
You count it strange? So once did I
Before I knew my Savior!

And, oh, that He fulfilled may see
The travail of His soul in me,
And with His work contented be,
As I with my dear Savior!

Yes, living, dying, let me bring
My strength, my solace from this spring
That He who lives to be my King
Once died to be my Savior!--------347
O happy day that fixed my choice
On Thee, my Savior and my God!
Well may this glowing heart rejoice,
And tell its raptures all abroad.

  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!
  He taught me how to watch and pray,
  And live rejoicing every day;
  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!

'Tis done  the great transaction's done;
I am my Lord's, and He is mine;
He drew me and I followed on,
Rejoiced to own the call divine.

  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!
  He taught me how to watch and pray,
  And live rejoicing every day;
  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!

Now rest, my long-divided heart,
Fixed on this blissful center, rest;
Here have I found a nobler part,
Here heav'nly pleasures fill my breast.

  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!
  He taught me how to watch and pray,
  And live rejoicing every day;
  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!

High heav'n that hears the solemn vow,
That vow renewed shall daily hear!
Till in life's latest hour I bow,
And bless, in death, a bond so dear.

  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!
  He taught me how to watch and pray,
  And live rejoicing every day;
  Happy day, happy day,
  When Jesus washed my sins away!--------348
Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This life has been a joy to me;
And 'mid earth's sorrows and its woe,
'Tis joy my Jesus here to know.

  O hallelujah, yes, 'tis joy!
  For it is Christ that I enjoy!
  On land or sea, what matters where?
  Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

The earth was once a bitter place
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now joy's begun within my soul,
'Twill last while endless ages roll.

  O hallelujah, yes, 'tis joy!
  For it is Christ that I enjoy!
  On land or sea, what matters where?
  Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell,
In cottage, or a mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

  O hallelujah, yes, 'tis joy!
  For it is Christ that I enjoy!
  On land or sea, what matters where?
  Where Jesus is, my joy is there.--------349
As pants the hart for cooling streams
When heated in the chase,
So longs my soul, O God, for Thee,
And Thy refreshing grace.

Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Trust God, who will employ
His aid for thee, and change these sighs
To thankful hymns of joy.

For Thee, my God, the living God,
My thirsty soul doth pine;
Oh, when shall I behold Thy face,
Thou Majesty Divine?

God of my strength, how long shall I,
Like one forgotten, mourn,
Forlorn, forsaken, and exposed
To my oppressor's scorn?

Why restless, why cast down, my soul?
Hope still, and thou shalt sing
The praise of Him who is thy God,
Thy health's eternal spring.--------350
My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,
Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;
'Tis His to lead me there  not mine, but His
At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.

So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,
And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard
Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.

No matter if the way be sometimes dark,
No matter though the cost be oft-times great,
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,
The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.

One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;
One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;
My God my glory here, from day to day,
And in the glory there my great Reward.--------351
God the Almighty, Uncreated Life,
List to my cry as I lie in the dust,
Fathomless glory all about Thee is;
Life Giver, my Creator, know Thee I must.

Oh, by the Cross, the passion of Thy Christ,
Oh, by the death of my Lord crucified,
From pow'r of darkness translate me today
Into the kingdom of Thy light to abide.

Fill from the center with Thine utmost filling,
Fill to circumf'rence, fill right to the brim;
Blaze forth, the light, the glory of Thy being
About and 'round me to the uttermost rim.

Life Uncreated, Thou most holy God,
Life-giving Spirit, oh, create in me
Something that speaks of Thee and of Thy glory,
Something compelling that will draw to Thee.

Father, I thank Thee that my quest is ended.
I reign in life with Christ upon the throne,
How satisfied to triumph now in Him,
The Cross the touchstone that makes me His own.--------352
In the wilderness for God!
Just a common bush aflame!
Thus may I be, blessed Lord,
For the glory of Thy Name.

Just a common bush to be,
Something in which God can dwell,
Something thru which God can speak,
Something thru which God can tell,

All His yearning over men,
All His purposes of love,
Flaming with no light of earth,
But with glory from above:

God Himself within the bush,
Nothing seen but just the flame;
Make me that, just that, O God,
For the glory of Thy Name.--------353
I need Jesus, my need I now confess;
No friend like Him in times of deep distress;
I need Jesus, the need I gladly own;
Though some may bear their load alone,
Yet I need Jesus.

  I need Jesus, I need Jesus,
  I need Jesus every day;
  Need Him in the sunshine hour,
  Need Him when the storm-clouds low'r;
  Every day along my way,
  Yes, I need Jesus.

I need Jesus, I need a friend like Him,
A friend to guide when paths of life are dim;
I need Jesus, when foes my soul assail;
Alone I know I can but fail,
So I need Jesus.

  I need Jesus, I need Jesus,
  I need Jesus every day;
  Need Him in the sunshine hour,
  Need Him when the storm-clouds low'r;
  Every day along my way,
  Yes, I need Jesus.

I need Jesus, I need Him to the end;
No one like Him, He is the sinner's friend;
I need Jesus, no other friend will do;
So constant, kind, so strong and true,
Yes, I need Jesus.

  I need Jesus, I need Jesus,
  I need Jesus every day;
  Need Him in the sunshine hour,
  Need Him when the storm-clouds low'r;
  Every day along my way,
  Yes, I need Jesus.--------354
Come in, O come! The door stands open now;
I knew Thy voice; Lord Jesus, it was Thou.
The sun has set long since; the storms begin;
'Tis time for Thee, my Savior, O come in!

Alas, ill-ordered shows the dreary room;
The household stuff lies heaped amidst the gloom,
The table empty stands, the couch undressed;
Ah, what a welcome for th' Eternal Guest!

Yet welcome, and tonight; this doleful scene
Is e'en itself my cause to hail Thee in;
This dark confusion e'en at once demands
Thine own bright presence, Lord, and ord'ring hands.

I seek no more to alter things, or mend,
Before the coming of so great a Friend;
All were at best unseemly; and 'twere ill
Beyond all else to keep Thee waiting still.

Come, not to find, but make this troubled heart
A dwelling worthy of Thee as Thou art;
To chase the gloom, the terror, and the sin:
Come, all Thyself, yea come, Lord Jesus, in!--------355
O blessed, living Lord,
Engage our hearts with Thee,
And strike within some answ'ring chord
To love so rich and free!

To know Thy loving heart!
To cleave to Thy blest side!
To gaze upon Thee where Thou art,
And in Thy love abide!

To walk with Thee below!
To learn Thy holy ways!
And more to Thine own stature grow,
To Thine eternal praise!

Thyself our one Desire!
Thyself our Object here!
The goal to which our hearts aspire
To meet Thee in the air!--------356
Thou Magnet of my soul!
Let me come nearer, till
The life of self pulsates no more,
But is forever still.

Thou Sunshine of my heart!
Fill Thou each crevice there,
And let Thy garden yield to Thee
A fragrance sweet and rare.

Thou Ransomer from death!
Possess Thy ransomed one:
Appropriate to Thine Own use
The spoil that Thou hast won.

Thou Lord of Life and Light!
I bow beneath Thy sway,
And count it holy privilege
Thy precepts to obey.

Thou Gift unspeakable!
Straight from God's heart of love;
I break my heart to give Thee room
And thus Thy sweetness prove.--------357
Come, Jesus, Lord, with holy fire,
Come, and my quickened heart inspire,
My conscience purged by blood;
Now to my soul Thyself reveal,
Thy mighty working let me feel,
Since I am born of God.

Let nothing now my heart divide,
Since with Thee I am crucified,
And live to God in Thee.
Dead to the world and all its toys,
Its idle pomp and fading joys,
Jesus, my glory be.

Now with a quenchless thirst inspire,
A longing, infinite desire,
And fill my craving heart.
Less than Thyself, oh, do not give,
In might Thyself within me live;
Come, all Thou hast and art.

My will be swallowed up in Thee,
Light in Thy light still may I see
In Thine unclouded face:
Called the full strength of trust to prove,
Let all my quickened heart be love,
My spotless life be praise.--------358
Love Divine, all love excelling,
Joy of heav'n, to earth come down;
Fix in us Thy humble dwelling,
All Thy faithful mercies crown.
Jesus, Thou art all compassion;
Pure, unbounded love Thou art;
Visit us with Thy salvation,
Enter every trembling heart.

Breathe, O breathe Thy loving Spirit
Into every troubled breast;
Let us all in Thee inherit,
Let us find the promised rest.
Take away the love of sinning;
Alpha and Omega be;
End of faith, as its beginning,
Set our hearts at liberty.

Come, Almighty, to deliver,
Let us all Thy life receive;
May Thy presence e'er be with us,
Never more Thy temples leave.
Thee we would be always blessing,
Serve Thee as Thou wouldst approve,
Pray, and praise Thee without ceasing,
Glory in Thy perfect love.

Finish, then, Thy new creation;
Pure and spotless let us be;
Let us see Thy great salvation
Perfectly restored in Thee;
Changed from glory into glory
Till with Thee we take our place,
Till we cast our crowns before Thee,
Lost in wonder, love and praise.--------359
O Light of light, shine in!
Cast out, this night of sin,
Create true day within:
O Light of light, shine in!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!

O Joy of joys, come in!
End Thou this grief of sin,
Create calm peace within:
O Joy of joys, come in!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!

O Life of life, pour in!
Expel this death of sin,
Awake true life within:
O Life of life, pour in!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!

O Love of love, flow in!
This hateful root of sin
Deal with, renew, within:
O Love of love, flow in!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!

O Heaven of heavens, descend!
This cloudy curtain rend,
And all earth's turmoil end:
O Heaven of heavens, descend!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!

My God and Lord, O come!
Of joys the Joy and Sum,
Make in this heart Thy home:
My God and Lord, O come!

  O Light, all light excelling,
  Make my heart Thy dwelling;
  O Joy, all grief dispelling,
  To my poor heart come in!--------360
O Everlasting Light,
Shine graciously within;
Brightest of all on earth that's bright,
Come, shine away my sin.

O Everlasting Truth,
Truest of all that's true,
Sure guide of erring age or youth,
Lead me, and teach me too.

O Everlasting Strength,
Uphold me in the way;
Bring me, in spite of foes, at length
To joy and light of day.

O Everlasting Love,
Wellspring of grace and peace,
Pour down Thy fulness from above,
Bid doubt and trouble cease.

O Everlasting Rest,
Lift off life's load of care;
Relieve, revive this burdened breast
And every sorrow bear.

Thou art in heaven our all,
Our all on earth art Thou;
Upon Thy glorious Name we call,
Lord Jesus, bless us now.--------361
O Love divine, by Christ revealed,
Incarnate Love that died for me,
To Thee myself I gladly yield,
I consecrate my all to Thee.

O Light divine, by Christ displayed,
Source of all light, who flesh became,
Shed Thy bright beams upon my head,
Burn in my heart a constant flame.

O Truth divine, by Christ made known,
All truth must Thy reflection be;
Within my heart set up Thy throne,
And in Thy freedom make me free.

O Cross divine, by Christ endured,
Thou cross on which He groaned and died,
And man's redemption thus secured,
In Thy blest shadow let me hide.

O Peace divine, by Christ bestowed,
Thy heavenly dove to earth come down,
May He within make His abode,
My life with His dear presence crown.

O Joy divine, by Christ possessed,
For which He did the cross endure,
Fill with Thyself and make me blest,
Contented, restful and secure.--------362
He died for me that I might live;
I live for Him who died,
My life, my love to Him I give
Jesus, the Crucified.

  O Jesus, my Lord and Savior,
  Help me to fully follow Thee
  In life and death and loving service,
  As Thou hast lived and died for me.

He died for me that I might die
To Satan, self, and sin;
O death so deep! O life so high!
Help me to enter in.

  O Jesus, my Lord and Savior,
  Help me to fully follow Thee
  In life and death and loving service,
  As Thou hast lived and died for me.

He lives for me that I may live
As spotless e'en as He;
Savior, to me Thy nature give,
And live Thy life in me.

  O Jesus, my Lord and Savior,
  Help me to fully follow Thee
  In life and death and loving service,
  As Thou hast lived and died for me.

He lives for me that I may give
His love to hearts that pine;
Let me like Him for others live,
And trace His steps divine.

  O Jesus, my Lord and Savior,
  Help me to fully follow Thee
  In life and death and loving service,
  As Thou hast lived and died for me.--------363
Lord, I would have Thyself in all Thy beauty,
Take Thou control of all my life just now;
In Thee to live, and move, and have my being,
With full abandon, Lord, to Thee I bow.

  Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,
  Thy risen life transforms the old to new;
  I take my stand upon Thy word of promise:
  Sin shall not have dominion over you!

Show me the things of which I am unconscious,
Lord, put Thy finger now upon my heart;
Whisper to me, through Thy blest Holy Spirit,
Tell me what grieves Him, that it may depart.

  Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,
  Thy risen life transforms the old to new;
  I take my stand upon Thy word of promise:
  Sin shall not have dominion over you!

Thou art my Victor over keen temptation,
Thou art my Shield, to meet the darts of sin;
Lord Jesus, Thou alone can keep me trusting,
And living out Thy glorious life within.

  Thy blood was shed to cleanse from sin, Lord Jesus,
  Thy risen life transforms the old to new;
  I take my stand upon Thy word of promise:
  Sin shall not have dominion over you!--------364
Jesus, my life, Thyself apply;
Thy Holy Spirit breathe;
My vile affections crucify;
Conform me to Thy death.

Conqu'ror of hell and earth and sin,
Still with the rebel strive;
Enter my soul and work within,
And kill and make alive.

More of Thy life, and more I have,
As the old Adam dies;
Bury me, Savior, in Thy grave,
That I with Thee may rise.

Reign in me, Lord; Thy foes control,
Who would not own Thy sway;
Diffuse Thine image through my soul;
Shine to the perfect day.

Scatter the last remains of sin,
And seal me Thine abode;
O make me glorious all within,
A temple built by God!--------365
Jesus, Thy life is mine,
Dwell evermore in me;
And let me see
That nothing can untwine
Thy life from mine.

Thy life in me be shown,
Lord, I would henceforth seek
To think and speak
Thy thoughts, Thy words alone,
No more my own.

Thy love, Thy joy, Thy peace,
Continuously impart
Unto my heart,
Fresh springs that never cease,
But still increase.

The blest reality
Of resurrection power,
Thy Church's dower,
Life more abundantly,
Lord, give to me.

Thy fullest gift, O Lord,
Now at Thy word I claim,
Through Thy dear Name,
And touch the rapturous chord
Of praise forth-poured.

Jesus, my life is Thine,
And evermore shall be
Hidden in Thee,
For nothing can untwine
Thy life from mine.--------366
Christ, whose glory fills the skies
Christ, the true, the only Light,
Sun of Righteousness, arise,
Triumph o'er the shades of night;
Dayspring from on high, be near,
Daystar, in my heart appear.

Dark and cheerless is the morn
Unaccompanied by Thee;
Joyless is the day's return,
Till Thy mercy's beams I see,
Till Thou inward light impart,
Glad my eyes, and warm my heart.

Visit then this soul of mine,
Pierce the gloom of sin and grief;
Fill me, Radiancy divine,
Scatter all my unbelief;
More and more Thyself display,
Shining to the perfect day.--------367
Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
Nor creed, nor form, nor word,
Nor holy Church, nor human love,
Compare with Thee, my Lord!

Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
Thy love has conquered me;
Beneath Thy Cross I die to self,
And live alone to Thee.

Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
My inmost being fill;
So shall I think as Thou dost think,
And will as Thou dost will.

Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
Thy life transfigure mine;
And through this veil of mortal flesh,
Lord, let Thy splendor shine.

Be Thou supreme, O Jesus Christ,
My soul exults in Thee;
To be Thy slave, to do Thy will,
Is my felicity.--------368
More love to Thee, O Lord,
More love to Thee!
Hear Thou the prayer I make
On bended knee;
This is my earnest plea:
More love, O Lord, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Once earthly joy I craved,
Sought peace and rest;
Now Thee alone I seek,
Give what is best;
This all my prayer shall be:
More love, O Lord, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Let sorrow do its work,
Send grief and pain;
Sweet are Thy messengers,
Sweet their refrain,
When they can sing with me,
More love, O Lord, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!

Then shall my latest breath
Whisper Thy praise;
This be the parting cry
My heart shall raise;
This still its prayer shall be:
More love, O Lord, to Thee,
More love to Thee,
More love to Thee!--------369
Let me love Thee, Thou art claiming
Every feeling of my soul;
Let that love in pow'r prevailing,
Render Thee my life, my all;
For life's burdens they are easy,
And life's sorrows lose their sting,
If they're carried, Lord, to please Thee,
If their pain Thy smile should win.

  Let me love Thee, Savior,
  Take my heart forever;
  Nothing but Thy favor
  My soul can satisfy.

Let me love Thee, come revealing
All Thy love has done for me;
Help my heart, so unbelieving,
By the sight of Calvary:
Let me see Thy love despising
All the shame my sins had brought;
By Thy torments realizing
What a price my pardon bought.

  Let me love Thee, Savior,
  Take my heart forever;
  Nothing but Thy favor
  My soul can satisfy.

Let me love Thee, I am gladdest
When I'm loving Thee, the best;
For in sunshine or in sadness
I can find in Thee a rest;
But without Thee life is fading,
Treasureless its choicest flowers;
Taken are its gifts eternal;
Left, its empty passing hours.

  Let me love Thee, Savior,
  Take my heart forever;
  Nothing but Thy favor
  My soul can satisfy.

Let me love Thee, love is mighty,
Swaying realms of deed and thought;
By it I shall walk uprightly,
I shall serve Thee as I ought:
Love will soften every sorrow,
Love will lighten every care,
Love unquestioning will follow,
Love will triumph, love will dare.

  Let me love Thee, Savior,
  Take my heart forever;
  Nothing but Thy favor
  My soul can satisfy.--------370
Abide with me! Fast falls the eventide;
The darkness deepens; Lord, with me abide!
When other helpers fail and comforts flee,
Help of the helpless, oh, abide with me.

Swift to its close ebbs out life's little day;
Earth's joys grow dim, its glories pass away;
Change and decay in all around I see;
O Thou who changest not, abide with me.

Come not in terrors, as the King of kings;
But kind and good, with healing in Thy wings:
Tears for all woes, a heart for every plea;
Come, Friend of sinners, thus abide with me.

I need Thy presence every passing hour:
What but Thy grace can foil the tempter's power?
Who like Thyself my guide and stay can be?
Through cloud and sunshine, oh, abide with me.

I fear no foe, with Thee at hand to bless:
Ills have no weight, and tears no bitterness:
Where is death's sting? Where, grave, thy victory?
I triumph still, if Thou abide with me.--------371
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.

  I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
  Every hour I need Thee;
  Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
  I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

  I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
  Every hour I need Thee;
  Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
  I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

  I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
  Every hour I need Thee;
  Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
  I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill.

  I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
  Every hour I need Thee;
  Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
  I come to Thee.

I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.

  I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
  Every hour I need Thee;
  Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
  I come to Thee.--------372
Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
Naught of this world's delusive dream;
I have renounced all sinful pleasure;
Jesus is mine, there's nothing between.

  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
  So that His blessed face may be seen;
  Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
  Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

Nothing between, like worldly pleasure;
Habits of life, though harmless they seem,
Must not my heart from Him e'er sever;
He is my all, there's nothing between.

  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
  So that His blessed face may be seen;
  Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
  Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

Nothing between, like pride or station;
Self-life or friends shall not intervene;
Though it may cost me much tribulation,
I am resolved; there's nothing between.

  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
  So that His blessed face may be seen;
  Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
  Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.

Nothing between, e'en many hard trials,
Though the whole world against me convene;
Watching with prayer and much self-denial,
I'll triumph at last, with nothing between.

  Nothing between my soul and the Savior,
  So that His blessed face may be seen;
  Nothing preventing the least of His favor,
  Keep the way clear! Let nothing between.--------373
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let me Thy glory see,
Draw my soul close to Thee,
Then speak in love to me
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let not earth's din and noise
Stifle Thy still small voice;
In it let me rejoice
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Nothing of earthly care,
Nothing of tear or prayer
No robe that self may wear
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Unbelief disappear,
Vanish each doubt and fear,
Fading when Thou art near
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Shine with unclouded ray,
Chasing each mist away,
O'er my whole heart bear sway
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Thus may I walk with Thee,
Thee only may I see,
Thine only let me be
Nothing between.

Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Till Thine eternal light,
Rising on earth's dark night,
Bursts on my open sight
Nothing between.--------374
Sun of my soul, Thou Savior dear,
It is not night if Thou be near;
Oh, may no earthborn cloud arise
To hide Thee from Thy servant's eyes.

When the soft dews of kindly sleep
My wearied eyelids gently steep,
Be my last thought how sweet to rest
Forever on my Savior's breast.

Abide with me from morn till eve,
For without Thee I cannot live;
Abide with me when night is nigh,
For without Thee I dare not die.

Come near, and bless us when we wake,
Ere through the world our way we take;
Till in the ocean of Thy love
We lose ourselves in Thee above.--------375
There is a place of quiet rest,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where sin cannot molest,
Near to the heart of God.

  O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
  Sent from the heart of God,
  Hold us, who wait before Thee,
  Near to the heart of God.

There is a place of comfort sweet,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where we our Savior meet,
Near to the heart of God.

  O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
  Sent from the heart of God,
  Hold us, who wait before Thee,
  Near to the heart of God.

There is a place of full release,
Near to the heart of God,
A place where all is joy and peace,
Near to the heart of God.

  O Jesus, blest Redeemer,
  Sent from the heart of God,
  Hold us, who wait before Thee,
  Near to the heart of God.--------376
Fill Thou my life, O Lord my God,
In every part with praise,
That my whole being may proclaim
Thy being and Thy ways.

Not for the lip of praise alone,
Nor e'en the praising heart,
I ask, but for a life made up
Of praise in every part:

Praise in the common things of life,
Its goings out and in;
Praise in each duty and each deed,
However small and mean.

Fill every part of me with praise;
Let all my being speak
Of Thee and of Thy love, O Lord,
Poor though I be and weak.

So shall no part of day or night
From sacredness be free,
But all my life, in every step,
Be fellowship with Thee.--------377
If the path I travel
Lead me to the cross,
If the way Thou choosest
Lead to pain and loss,
Let the compensation
Daily, hourly, be
Shadowless communion,
Blessed Lord, with Thee.

If there's less of earth joy,
Give, Lord, more of heaven.
Let the spirit praise Thee,
Though the heart be riven;
If sweet earthly ties, Lord,
Break at Thy decree,
Let the tie that binds us,
Closer, sweeter, be.

Lonely though the pathway,
Cheer it with Thy smile;
Be Thou my companion
Through earth's little while;
Selfless may I live, Lord,
By Thy grace to be
Just a cleansd channel
For Thy life through me.--------378
Savior, lead me up the mountain,
Where the Lord alone is seen,
Where we hear the voice from heaven,
Where the air is pure and clean.

  Lead me higher up the mountain,
  Give me fellowship with Thee;
  In Thy light I see the fountain,
  And the blood it cleanses me.

Higher up where light increases,
Far above all earthly strife,
Where the strain of effort ceases,
Where in Christ we reign in Life.

  Lead me higher up the mountain,
  Give me fellowship with Thee;
  In Thy light I see the fountain,
  And the blood it cleanses me.

Savior, keep me up the mountain
Pressing on toward the goal,
Till, as one, we share Thine image,
And Thy love and grace extol.

  Lead me higher up the mountain,
  Give me fellowship with Thee;
  In Thy light I see the fountain,
  And the blood it cleanses me.--------379
I hunger and I thirst;
Jesus, my manna be;
Ye living waters, burst
Out of the rock for me.

Thou bruised and broken Bread,
My lifelong wants supply;
As living souls are fed,
O feed me, or I die.

Thou true life-giving Vine,
Let me Thy sweetness prove;
Renew my life with Thine,
Refresh my soul with love.

For still the desert lies
My thirsting soul before;
O living waters, rise
Within me evermore.--------380
O Bread to pilgrims given,
O Food for saints to eat,
O Manna sent from heaven,
For heav'n-born natures meet;
Give us, for Thee long pining,
To eat till richly filled;
Till, earth's delights resigning,
Our every wish is stilled.

O Water, life bestowing,
From out the Savior's heart,
A fountain purely flowing,
A fount of love Thou art.
Oh, let us, freely tasting,
Our burning thirst assuage;
Thy sweetness, never wasting,
Avails from age to age.

Jesus, this feast receiving,
We Thee unseen adore;
Thy faithful word believing,
We take, and doubt no more.
Give us, Thou true and loving,
On earth to live in Thee;
Then, God the veil removing,
Thy glorious face to see.--------381
Fill all my vision, Savior, I pray,
Let me see only Jesus today;
Though through the valley Thou leadest me,
Thy fadeless glory encompasseth me.

  Fill all my vision, Savior divine,
  Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.
  Fill all my vision, that all may see
  Thy Holy Image reflected in me.

Fill all my vision, every desire
Keep for Thy glory; my soul inspire
With Thy perfection, Thy holy love,
Flooding my pathway with light from above.

  Fill all my vision, Savior divine,
  Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.
  Fill all my vision, that all may see
  Thy Holy Image reflected in me.

Fill all my vision, let naught of sin
Shadow the brightness shining within.
Let me see only Thy blessed face,
Feasting my soul on Thy infinite grace.

  Fill all my vision, Savior divine,
  Till with Thy glory my spirit shall shine.
  Fill all my vision, that all may see
  Thy Holy Image reflected in me.--------382
More about Jesus would I know,
More of His grace to others show;
More of His saving fulness see,
More of His love who died for me.

  More, more about Jesus,
  More, more about Jesus;
  More of His saving fulness see,
  More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus let me learn,
More of His holy will discern;
Spirit of God my teacher be,
Showing the things of Christ to me.

  More, more about Jesus,
  More, more about Jesus;
  More of His saving fulness see,
  More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus; in His Word,
Holding communion with my Lord;
Hearing His voice in every line,
Making each faithful saying mine.

  More, more about Jesus,
  More, more about Jesus;
  More of His saving fulness see,
  More of His love who died for me.

More about Jesus; on His throne,
Riches in glory all His own;
More of His kingdom's sure increase;
More of His coming, Prince of Peace.

  More, more about Jesus,
  More, more about Jesus;
  More of His saving fulness see,
  More of His love who died for me.--------383
My stubborn will at last hath yielded;
I would be Thine, and Thine alone,
And this the prayer my lips are bringing,
"Lord, let in me Thy will be done."

  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee.

I'm tired of sin, footsore and weary,
The darksome path hath dreary grown,
But now a light has ris'n to cheer me;
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.

  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee.

Thy precious will, O conqu'ring Savior,
Doth now embrace and compass me;
All discords hushed, my peace a river,
My soul a prisoned bird set free.

  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee.

Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,
My wayward feet no more to roam;
What pow'r from Thee my soul can sever?
The center of God's will my home.

  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
  Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
  Till I am wholly lost in Thee.--------384
My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
Oh, may Thy will be mine!
Into Thy hand of love
I would my all resign;
Through sorrow, or through joy,
Conduct me as Thine own,
And help me still to say,
My Lord, Thy will be done!

My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
Though seen through many a tear,
Let not my star of hope
Grow dim or disappear;
Since Thou on earth hast wept,
And sorrowed oft alone,
If I must weep with Thee,
My Lord, Thy will be done!

My Jesus, as Thou wilt!
All shall be well for me;
Each changing future scene
I gladly trust with Thee.
Straight to Thy rest above
I travel calmly on,
And sing, in life or death,
My Lord, Thy will be done!--------385
Oh, tame me, Lord! Rebellious nature calm,
Oh, tame me, Lord!
This heart, so tossed and filled with wild alarm,
Oh, tame me, Lord!
These human longings, let them end in Thee,
And let me be Thy bondslave, even me!

I will not ask Thee to account to me
For aught Thou dost;
For crosses sore, or paths I cannot see:
But I will trust.
No second causes shall perplex my soul,
Or stay from yielding all to Thy control.

The raging storm I dare not fight alone,
Ah, show Thy face!
Say, "It is I!" Thyself to me make known,
Ah, show Thy face!
Then what care I for darkest depths of woe?
Thine arms, O Christ, shall fold me close, I know!

Oh, save me, Lord! Subdue this stubborn will;
Oh, save me, Lord!
In spite of all, Thy purposes fulfill
In me, Oh, Lord;
I yield my self, and all I have and am,
To follow Thee, Thou all redeeming Lamb!

How can I fear? Thou art so near to me;
How can I fear?
I hear Thee say, "Believe, and thou shalt see!"
How can I fear?
I now believe, and trust Thy mighty power,
To save, to heal, to keep this very hour!--------386
Thou my everlasting Portion,
More than friend or life to me,
All along my pilgrim journey,
Savior, let me walk with Thee.

  Close to Thee, close to Thee,
  Close to Thee, close to Thee;
  All along my pilgrim journey,
  Savior, let me walk with Thee.

Not for ease or worldly pleasure,
Not for fame my prayer shall be;
Gladly will I toil and suffer,
Only let me walk with Thee.

  Close to Thee, close to Thee,
  Close to Thee, close to Thee;
  Gladly will I toil and suffer,
  Only let me walk with Thee.

Lead me through the vale of shadows,
Bear me o'er life's fitful sea;
Then the gate of life eternal
May I enter, Lord, with Thee.

  Close to Thee, close to Thee,
  Close to Thee, close to Thee;
  Then the gate of life eternal
  May I enter, Lord, with Thee.--------387
I am Thine, O Lord, I have heard Thy voice,
And it told Thy love to me;
But I long to rise in the arms of faith,
And be closer drawn to Thee.

  Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To the cross where Thou hast died;
  Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To Thy precious, bleeding side.

Consecrate me now to Thy service, Lord,
By the pow'r of grace divine;
Let my soul look up with a steadfast hope,
And my will be lost in Thine.

  Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To the cross where Thou hast died;
  Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To Thy precious, bleeding side.

O the pure delight of a single hour
That before Thy throne I spend,
When I kneel in prayer, and with Thee, my God,
I commune as friend with friend!

  Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To the cross where Thou hast died;
  Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To Thy precious, bleeding side.

There are depths of love that I yet may know
Ere Thee face to face I see;
There are heights of joy that I yet may reach
Ere I rest in peace with Thee.

  Draw me nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To the cross where Thou hast died;
  Draw me nearer, nearer, nearer, blessed Lord,
  To Thy precious, bleeding side.--------388
Hold Thou my hand: so weak I am, and helpless;
I dare not take one step without Thy aid.
Hold Thou my hand: for then, O Loving Savior,
No dread of ill shall make my soul afraid.

Hold Thou my hand: and closer, closer draw me
To Thy dear self, my hope, my joy, my all;
Hold Thou my hand: lest haply I should wander,
And missing Thee, my trembling feet should fall.

Hold Thou my hand: the way is dark before me
Without the sunlight of Thy face divine;
But when by faith I catch its radiant glory,
What heights of joy, what rapturous songs are mine.--------389
Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live,
From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
O let not my heart be contented or rest
When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.
Each moment, each day, throughout suff'ring and pain,
When nought in the world can give comfort or cheer,
When sighing and weeping encompasses me,
Lord, still all my sighing and wipe every tear.

Each time when I dream of the goodness of life,
I pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be;
O do not allow me to choose by myself,
Nor seek any pleasure that's other than Thee.
Each night when alone in the stillness I lie,
I pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near;
Each morning ere dawn comes, while still in my sleep,
Then whispering call me and open my ear.

Each time, Lord, when reading in Thy holy Word,
I pray that Thy glory may shine on each line,
That clearly I'll see what a Savior I have
And how great salvation that Thou hast made mine.
When helpless I come, Lord, to kneel at Thy throne,
I pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace;
If thru my shortcomings Thou hear not my prayer,
Withdraw not Thy presence, O hide not Thy face.

Each time when of heavenly blessings I think,
O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;
My only hope here is Thy coming again,
My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.
Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live,
From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
O let not my heart be contented or rest
When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.--------390
Savior, lead me, this I pray,
In the Spirit all the day;
Walking in the light of life,
I would cease from all my strife.

  Lead me, lead me,
  Savior, lead me, this I pray;
  Deeply in the stream of life,
  Lead me, Savior, in Thy way.

Thou as life in me indeed,
By the law of life dost lead;
When Thou reignest in Thy might,
All my darkness turns to light.

  Lead me, lead me,
  Savior, lead me, this I pray;
  Deeply in the stream of life,
  Lead me, Savior, in Thy way.

Liberating Spirit, Thou,
Wholly regulate me now;
Thus my mind Thou wilt renew
And Thy will I'll fully know.

  Lead me, lead me,
  Savior, lead me, this I pray;
  Deeply in the stream of life,
  Lead me, Savior, in Thy way.--------391
Guide me, O Thou gracious Savior,
Pilgrim through this barren land;
I am weak, but Thou art mighty,
Hold me with Thy pow'rful hand;
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more;
Bread of heaven,
Feed me till I want no more.

Open now the crystal fountain,
Whence the healing waters flow;
Let the fiery, cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through;
Strong Deliv'rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield;
Strong Deliv'rer,
Be Thou still my strength and shield.--------392
Jesus, Savior, pilot me
Over life's tempestuous sea;
Unknown waves before me roll,
Hiding rock and treach'rous shoal;
Chart and compass come from Thee;
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

As a mother stills her child,
Thou canst hush the ocean wild;
Boist'rous waves obey Thy will
When Thou say'st to them, "Be still."
Wondrous Sov'reign of the sea,
Jesus, Savior, pilot me.

Though death's valley I may pass,
Still Thy grace will fear surpass;
In Thy presence I will rest,
And, while leaning on Thy breast,
I will hear Thee say to me,
"Fear not, I will pilot thee."--------393
Thy way, not mine, O Lord,
However dark it be;
Lead me by Thine own hand,
Choose out the path for me.

Smooth let it be, or rough,
It will be still the best;
Winding or straight it leads
Right onward to Thy rest.

I dare not choose my lot;
I would not if I might:
Choose Thou for me, my God,
So shall I walk aright.

Take Thou my cup, and it
With joy or sorrow fill,
As best to Thee may seem;
Choose Thou my good and ill.

Choose Thou for me my friends,
My sickness or my health.
Choose Thou my cares for me,
My poverty or wealth.

Not mine, not mine the choice,
In things both great and small;
Be Thou my guide, my strength,
My wisdom and my all.--------394
Unto him that hath Thou givest
Ever more abundantly;
Lord, I live because Thou livest,
Therefore give more life to me,
Therefore speed me in the race,
Therefore let me grow in grace.

Deepen all Thy work, O Master,
Strengthen every downward root;
Only do Thou ripen faster,
More and more Thy pleasant fruit;
Purge me, prune me, self abase;
Only let me grow in grace.

Let me grow by sun and shower,
Every moment water me;
Make me really, hour by hour,
More and more conformed to Thee,
That Thy loving eye may trace
Day by day my growth in grace.

From Thy fulness grace outpouring,
Show me ever greater things;
Raise me higher, sunward soaring,
Mounting as on eagle-wings.
By the brightness of Thy face,
Ever let me grow in grace.

Let me, then, be always growing,
Never, never standing still,
Listening, learning, better knowing
Thee and Thy most blessed will.
Till I win the glorious race,
Daily let me grow in grace.--------395
O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,
And all things else recede;
My heart be daily nearer Thee,
From sin be daily freed.

  Each day let Thy supporting might
  My weakness still embrace;
  My darkness vanish in Thy light,
  Thy life my death efface.

In Thy bright beams which on me fall,
Fade every evil thought;
That I am nothing, Thou art all,
I would be daily taught.

  Each day let Thy supporting might
  My weakness still embrace;
  My darkness vanish in Thy light,
  Thy life my death efface.

More of Thy glory let me see,
Thou Holy, Wise, and True;
I would Thy living image be,
In joy and sorrow too.

  Each day let Thy supporting might
  My weakness still embrace;
  My darkness vanish in Thy light,
  Thy life my death efface.

Fill me with gladness from above,
Hold me by strength divine;
Lord, let the glow of Thy great love
Through all my being shine.

  Each day let Thy supporting might
  My weakness still embrace;
  My darkness vanish in Thy light,
  Thy life my death efface.

Make this poor self grow less and less,
Be Thou my life and aim;
Oh, make me daily through Thy grace
More meet to bear Thy name.

  Each day let Thy supporting might
  My weakness still embrace;
  My darkness vanish in Thy light,
  Thy life my death efface.--------396
I'm pressing on the upward way,
New heights I'm gaining every day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
"Lord, plant my feet on higher ground."

  Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
  By faith on Canaan's tableland;
  A higher plane than I have found,
  Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

  Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
  By faith on Canaan's tableland;
  A higher plane than I have found,
  Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

I want to live above the world,
Though Satan's darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

  Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
  By faith on Canaan's tableland;
  A higher plane than I have found,
  Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I'll pray till rest I've found,
"Lord, lead me on to higher ground.''

  Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
  By faith on Canaan's tableland;
  A higher plane than I have found,
  Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.--------397
More holiness give me,
More sweetness within,
More patience in suff'ring,
More sorrow for sin,
More faith in my Savior,
More sense of His care,
More joy in His service,
More freedom in prayer.

  Come, my Savior, and help me,
  Comfort, strengthen and keep me;
  Thou each moment wilt save me,
  Thou art saving me now.

More gratitude give me,
More trust in the Lord,
More zeal for His glory,
More hope in His Word,
More tears for His sorrows,
More pain at His grief,
More meekness in trial,
More praise for relief.

  Come, my Savior, and help me,
  Comfort, strengthen and keep me;
  Thou each moment wilt save me,
  Thou art saving me now.

More victory give me,
More strength to o'ercome,
More freedom from earth-stains,
More quest for the throne,
More fit for the kingdom,
More useful I'd be,
More blessed and holy,
More, Savior, like Thee.

  Come, my Savior, and help me,
  Comfort, strengthen and keep me;
  Thou each moment wilt save me,
  Thou art saving me now.--------398
O to be like Thee! blessed Redeemer;
This is my constant longing and prayer;
Gladly I'll forfeit all of earth's treasures,
Jesus, Thy perfect likeness to wear.

  O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
  Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
  Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
  Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

O to be like Thee! full of compassion,
Loving, forgiving, tender and kind,
Helping the helpless, cheering the fainting,
Seeking the wand'ring sinners to find.

  O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
  Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
  Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
  Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

O to be like Thee! lowly in spirit,
Holy and harmless, patient and brave;
Meekly enduring cruel reproaches,
Willing to suffer, others to save.

  O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
  Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
  Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
  Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

O to be like Thee! Lord, I am coming,
Now to receive th' anointing divine;
All that I am and have I am bringing;
Lord, from this moment all shall be Thine.

  O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
  Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
  Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
  Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.

O to be like Thee! While I am pleading
Pour out Thy Spirit, fill with Thy love.
Make me a temple meet for Thy dwelling,
Fit for a life which Thou wouldst approve.

  O to be like Thee! O to be like Thee!
  Blessed Redeemer, pure as Thou art;
  Come in Thy sweetness, come in Thy fullness;
  Stamp Thine own image deep on my heart.--------399
Changed into His likeness!
This my heart's desire!
May the Lord fulfill it,
All my soul inspire.

Changed into His likeness!
He the Spirit is!
If the Spirit governs,
He'll fulfill my wish.

As a glass, beholding
With uncovered face,
I can see His glory
And reflect His grace.

O that no more covering
May the Lord obscure,
That I may reflect Him
With a heart made pure.

Gazing on His glory,
Face to face to see;
Constantly beholding,
Ever would I be.

Changed into His likeness!
This my heart's one quest!
From my heart reflected,
He will be expressed.

Changed into His likeness
And reflecting more
Glory unto glory,
Boundless evermore.--------400
Earthly pleasures vainly call me,
I would be like Jesus;
Nothing worldly shall enthrall me,
I would be like Jesus.

  Be like Jesus, this my song,
  In the home and in the throng;
  Be like Jesus, all day long!
  I would be like Jesus.

He has broken every fetter,
I would be like Jesus;
That my soul may serve Him better,
I would be like Jesus.

  Be like Jesus, this my song,
  In the home and in the throng;
  Be like Jesus, all day long!
  I would be like Jesus.

All the way from earth to glory,
I would be like Jesus;
Telling o'er and o'er the story,
I would be like Jesus.

  Be like Jesus, this my song,
  In the home and in the throng;
  Be like Jesus, all day long!
  I would be like Jesus.--------401
May the mind of Christ my Savior
Live in me from day to day,
By His love and pow'r controlling
All I do and say.

May the Word of Christ dwell richly
In my heart from hour to hour,
So that all may see I triumph
Only through His pow'r.

May the peace of Christ my Savior
Rule my life in every thing,
That I may be calm to comfort
Sick and sorrowing.

May the love of Jesus fill me,
As the waters fill the sea;
Him exalting, self abasing,
This is victory.

May I run the race before me,
Strong and brave to face the foe,
Looking only unto Jesus
As I onward go.

May His beauty rest upon me
As I seek the lost to win,
And may they forget the channel,
Seeing only Him.--------402
I want that adorning divine,
Thou only, my Lord, canst bestow;
I want in those beautiful garments to shine,
Which mark out Thy beauty below.

I want every moment to feel
Thy Spirit indwelling my heart,
His pow'r ever present to cleanse and to heal,
And newness of life to impart.

I want, oh, I want to attain
Some likeness, my Savior, to Thee;
That longed-for resemblance once more to regain;
Thy comeliness put upon me.

I want to be marked for Thine own,
Thy seal on my forehead to wear;
And have that new name on the mystic white stone,
Which none but Thyself can declare.

I want, and this sums up my prayer,
To glorify Thee till I die;
Then calmly to yield up my soul to Thy care,
And breathe out in faith my last sigh!--------403
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
For my very life art Thou;
Thee I take to all my problems
As the full solution now.
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
In all things Thy will be done;
I but a transparent vessel
To make visible the Son.

Consecrated is Thy temple,
Purged from every stain and sin;
May Thy flame of glory now be
Manifested from within.
Let the earth in solemn wonder
See my body willingly
Offered as Thy slave obedient,
Energized alone by Thee.

Every moment, every member,
Girded, waiting Thy command;
Underneath the yoke to labor
Or be laid aside as planned.
When restricted in pursuing,
No disquiet will beset;
Underneath Thy faithful dealing
Not a murmur or regret.

Ever tender, quiet, restful,
Inclinations put away,
That Thou may for me choose freely
As Thy finger points the way.
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
For my very life art Thou
Thee I take to all my problems
As the full solution now.--------404
Let me come closer to Thee, Lord Jesus,
Oh, closer day by day;
Let me lean harder on Thee, Lord Jesus,
Yes, harder, all the way.

Let me show forth Thy beauty, Lord Jesus,
Like sunshine on the hills;
Oh, let my lips pour forth all Thy sweetness
In joyous sparkling rills.

Yes, like a channel, precious Lord Jesus,
Make me and let me be;
Keep me and use me daily, Lord Jesus,
For Thee, for only Thee.

In all my heart and will, O Lord Jesus,
Be altogether king;
Make me a loyal subject, Lord Jesus,
To Thee in everything.

Thirsting and hungering for Thee, Lord Jesus,
With blessed hunger here.
Longing for New Jerusalem's fullness
No thirst, no hunger there.--------405
Having seen the world's fair beauty,
Lord, I would be blind once more,
Lest I lose the loving Presence
And Delight I knew before.

  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
  Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.

Dawn and sunset, star and moonlight,
I can see in paradise,
But while here on earth His mercy
For my blindness will suffice.

  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
  Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.

I no more would be delivered
From my thorn, but look for grace,
While within the veil His glory
Shineth brightly on my face.

  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
  Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.

In the deep dark night, His beauty
I by faith, not sight, may trace;
He was ridiculed and hated,
Yet I see His glorious face.

  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
  Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.

Sun and moonlight far surpassing,
Clouds and Milky Way o'erspread,
Is the glory all transcending
Shining from His thorn-crowned head.

  Having seen the world's fair beauty,
  Lord, I would be blind once more,
  Lest I lose the loving Presence
  And Delight I knew before.--------406
Teach me Thy way, O Lord,
Teach me Thy way;
Thy gracious aid afford,
Teach me Thy way.
Help me to walk aright;
More by faith, less by sight;
Lead me with heav'nly light,
Teach me Thy way.

When doubts and fears arise,
Teach me Thy way;
When storms o'erspread the skies,
Teach me Thy way.
Shine through the cloud and rain,
Through sorrow, toil, and pain;
Make Thou my pathway plain,
Teach me Thy way.

Long as my life shall last,
Teach me Thy way;
Where'er my lot be cast,
Teach me Thy way.
Until the race is run,
Until the journey's done,
Until the crown is won,
Teach me Thy way.--------407
Search me, O God, my actions try,
And let my life appear
As seen by Thine all-searching eye
To mine my ways make clear.

Search all my sense, and know my heart
Who only canst make known,
And let the deep, the hidden part
To me be fully shown.

Throw light into the darkened cells,
Where passion reigns within;
Quicken my conscience till it feels
The loathsomeness of sin.

Search all my thoughts, the secret springs,
The motives that control;
The chambers where polluted things
Hold empire o'er the soul.

Search, till Thy fiery glance has cast
Its holy light through all,
And I by grace am brought at last
Before Thy face to fall.

Thus prostrate I shall learn of Thee,
What now I feebly prove,
That God alone in Christ can be
Unutterable love.--------408
Lord Jesus, I long to be perfectly whole,
I want Thee forever to live in my soul;
Break down every idol, cast out every foe;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, let nothing unholy remain,
Apply Thine own blood and extract every stain;
To get this blest cleansing I all things forego;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, look down from Thy throne in the skies,
And help me to make a complete sacrifice;
I give up myself and whatever I know;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, for this I most humbly entreat;
I wait, blessed Lord, at Thy crucified feet;
By faith, for my cleansing I see Thy blood flow;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

Lord Jesus, Thou seest I patiently wait;
Come now, and within me a new heart create;
To those who have sought Thee Thou never saidst, No;
Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

  Whiter than snow; yes, whiter than snow;
  Now wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.--------409
One thing I of the Lord desire,
For all my path hath miry been:
Be it by water or by fire,
Oh, make me clean, oh, make me clean!

  So wash me, Thou, without, within,
  Or purge with fire, if that must be;
  No matter how, if only sin
  Die out in me, die out in me.

I watch to shun the miry way,
And staunch the springs of guilty thought;
But, watch and struggle as I may,
Pure I am not, pure I am not.

  So wash me, Thou, without, within,
  Or purge with fire, if that must be;
  No matter how, if only sin
  Die out in me, die out in me.

If clearer vision Thou impart,
Grateful and glad my soul shall be,
But yet to have a purer heart
Is more to me, is more to me.

  So wash me, Thou, without, within,
  Or purge with fire, if that must be;
  No matter how, if only sin
  Die out in me, die out in me.

Yea, only as this heart is clean
May larger vision yet be mine,
For mirrored in the depths are seen
The things divine, the things divine.

  So wash me, Thou, without, within,
  Or purge with fire, if that must be;
  No matter how, if only sin
  Die out in me, die out in me.--------410
Oh, for a heart to praise my God,
A heart from sin set free,
With conscience sprinkled by the blood
So freely shed for me.

A heart resigned, submissive, meek,
My dear Redeemer's throne;
Where only Christ is heard to speak,
Where Jesus reigns alone.

A humble, lowly, contrite heart,
Believing, true, and clean,
Which neither death nor life can part
From Him that dwells within.

A heart in every thought renewed,
And filled with love divine;
Perfect and right, and pure and good,
A copy, Lord, of Thine.

Thy nature, gracious Lord, impart,
Come quickly from above;
Write Thy new name upon my heart,
Thy new, best name of Love.--------411
Bless'd are the pure in heart,
For they shall see our God;
The secret of the Lord is theirs,
Their heart is Christ's abode.

The Lord, who left the heavens,
Our life and peace to bring,
To dwell in lowliness with men,
Their pattern and their King.

He to the lowly soul
Doth still Himself impart,
And for His dwelling and His throne
Chooseth the pure in heart.

Lord, we Thy presence seek;
May ours this blessing be;
Give us a pure and lowly heart,
A temple meet for Thee.--------412
Lord, reveal Thyself to me,
That the flesh I'll fully know;
May Thy grace so work in me,
That in dust I'll lowly bow.
How I long for victory,
Yet, thru all my life, how weak!
Evil things I cannot leave,
Nor can do the good I seek.

Inwardly I want the Lord,
But my conduct hateful is;
Though I would, I cannot change,
O what real bondage 'tis!
By God's law my sin's revealed,
But the law of sin doth bind;
Though I struggle to be free,
No release my soul can find.

Many times I fall and rise,
Oft resolve, and often fail;
Craving vict'ry, I retreat,
And my sad defeat bewail.
Truly I am sold to sin
And completely powerless;
There's no good within my flesh,
All is dark and sinfulness.

Now I know myself in part,
And confess my helplessness;
All my temperament is odd,
All my life corrupted is.
Subtle self I cannot trust,
Nor to fleshly strength can cling;
All my trust and all my hope
Is in Jesus Christ my King.

May the Cross put me to death
That on Christ I may rely;
May His Holy Spirit fill,
That Himself I may apply.
May His death so work in me
Daily deeper than before,
That my self may be destroyed
And His life thru me may pour.

O how bitter is my case!
Who this wretched slave can free,
Who deliver from this death,
To a life of victory?
Jesus shed His blood for me,
Christ is now my holiness;
I receive Him as my life
And my portion measureless.

Now I'm wholly sanctified,
Selfless, I obey His word;
Nevermore to feel ashamed
When I come before the Lord.
How transcendent is this life!
Grace thru faith He gives to me!
Praise the Lord, He heard my cry
And has made me wholly free.--------413
Jesus, cast a look on me;
Give me sweet simplicity;
Make me poor, and keep me low,
Seeking only Thee to know.

Weaned from all my lordly self,
Weaned from all the miser's pelf,
Weaned from all the scorner's ways,
Weaned from all the lust of praise.

All that feeds my busy pride,
Cast it evermore aside;
Bid my will to Thine submit,
Lay me humbly at Thy feet.

Make me like a little child,
Of my strength and wisdom spoiled;
Seeing only in Thy light,
Walking only in Thy might;

Leaning on Thy loving breast,
Where a weary soul may rest;
Feeling well the peace of God
Flowing from Thy precious blood.

In this posture let me live,
And hosannas daily give;
In this temper let me die,
And hosannas ever cry.--------414
My Savior, Thou has offered rest:
Oh, give it then to me;
The rest of ceasing from myself,
To find my all in Thee.

This cruel self, oh, how it strives
And works within my breast,
To come between Thee and my soul,
And keep me back from rest.

How many subtle forms it takes
Of seeming verity,
As if it were not safe to rest
And venture all on Thee.

O Lord, I seek a holy rest,
A victory over sin;
I seek that Thou alone shouldst reign
O'er all without, within.

In Thy strong hand I lay me down,
So shall the work be done;
For who can work so wondrously
As the Almighty One?

Work on, then, Lord, till on my soul
Eternal light shall break,
And, in Thy likeness perfected,
I "satisfied" shall wake.--------415
There is a foe whose hidden pow'r
The Christian well my fear,
More subtle far than inbred sin,
And to the heart more dear.
It is the pow'r of selfishness,
It is the willful I,
And ere my Lord can live in me,
My very self must die.

There is, like Anak's sons of old,
A race of giants still:
Self-glorying, self-confidence,
Self-seeking and self-will.
Still must these haughty Anakims
By Caleb's sword be slain,
Ere Hebron's heights of heav'nly love,
Our conqu'ring feet can gain.

Oh, save me from self-will, dear Lord,
Which claims Thy sacred throne;
Oh! Let my will be lost in Thine,
And let Thy will be done.
Oh, keep me from self-confidence,
And self-sufficiency;
Let me exchange my strength for Thine,
And lean alone on Thee.

Oh, save me from self-seeking, Lord,
Let me not be my own;
A living sacrifice I come,
Lord, keep me Thine alone.
From proud vain glory save me, Lord,
From pride of praise and fame;
To Christ be all the honor given,
The glory to His name.

Oh, Savior, slay the self in me
By Thy consuming breath;
Show me Thy heart, Thy wounds, Thy shame,
That self be put to death.
When the Shekinah flame came down,
E'en Moses could not stay;
So let Thy glory fill me now,
And self forever slay.--------416
Lower and lower, dear Lord, at Thy feet,
Seeking Thy Spirit, Thy mercy so sweet;
Down in our need, blessed Master, we fall,
Lower and lower; be Thou all in all.

  Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
  All the world's treasure counting but dross;
  Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
  Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!

Lower and lower, dear Savior, we pray,
Losing the self-life still more every day;
Weak and unworthy, we're looking above;
Empty us wholly; then fill us with love.

  Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
  All the world's treasure counting but dross;
  Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
  Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!

Lower and lower; yet higher we rise,
Lifted in Christ, freed from all the earth ties;
Humbly we follow the way of the cross,
Then, crowns of glory, and gain for all loss.

  Lower and lower, down at Thy cross,
  All the world's treasure counting but dross;
  Down at Thy feet, blessed Savior, we fall,
  Lower, still lower, Christ all in all!--------417
Deep in me, Lord, mark Thou Thy holy Cross,
On motives, choices, private dear desires.
Let all that self in any form inspires
Be unto me as dross.

And when Thy touch of death is here and there
Laid on a thing most precious in mine eyes,
Let me not wonder, let me recognize
The answer to my prayer.--------418
From pray'r that asks that I may be
Sheltered from winds that beat on Thee,
From fearing when I should aspire,
From falt'ring when I should climb high'r,
From silken self, O Captain, free
Thy soldier who would follow Thee.

From subtle love of softening things,
From easy choices, weakenings,
(Not thus are spirits fortified,
Not this way went the Crucified),
From all that dims Thy Calvary,
O Lamb of God, deliver me.

Give me the love that leads the way,
The faith that nothing can dismay,
The hope no disappointments tire,
The passion that will burn like fire,
Let me sink to be a clod:
Make me Thy fuel, O flame of God.--------419
O God, unblessing and unblest,
A withered plant, but not at rest,
A useless cumberer I'm found
Upon Thy field, Thy purchased ground;
And yet I pray  "Do not forsake me,
But in Thy hand, O Savior, take me.

As women take unbroken flax,
As molders take unshapen wax,
As smith, the iron, rough and cold,
A useful instrument to mold,
So in Thy skillful hands, O take me,
And never let Thy love forsake me."

Like rock uncrushed, the stubborn will,
Though bearing gold is barren still;
Like marble in the quarry rough,
The natural heart is useless stuff;
And so, I pray  "Do not forsake me,
But with Thy hand, O Savior, break me.

As mortars crush the hardest rock,
As hammers break the stony block,
As millstones bruise the finest wheat,
As nuts are broken for their meat,
So with Thy mighty hand, O break me,
And never let Thy love forsake me.

Though crushed and broken, yet I'm nought
But fragments to the furnace brought;
Though bruised, I have no worth to feed
The multitudes that die in need;
And so, I pray  "Do not forsake me,
But meet for service, Savior, make me.

As into useful forms the ore
From molten scraps the molders' pour;
As fire doth make the bruisd wheat,
When mixed and molded, fit to eat;
So, fit for use by fire, O make me,
And never let Thy love forsake me."--------420
Jesus, Redeemer and my one Inspirer,
Heat in my coldness, set my life aglow.
Break down my barriers; draw, yea, draw me nigher.
Thee would I know, whom it is life to know.

Deepen me, rid me of the superficial;
From pale delusion set my spirit free;
All the entangled in me quick unravel;
Pluck forth each thread of insincerity.

The vows are on me, oh to serve Thee truly
Love perfectly, in purity obey
Burn, burn, O Fire, O Wind, now winnow throughly;
O Sword, awake against the flesh and slay.--------421
Jesus, meek and gentle,
Son of God most High,
Pitying, loving Savior,
Hear Thy children's cry.

Pardon our offences,
Loose our captive chains,
Break down every idol
Which our soul detains.

Give us holy freedom,
Fill our heart with grace;
Lead us on our journey,
Till we win the race.

Jesus, meek and gentle,
Son of God most high,
Pitying, loving Savior,
Hear Thy children's cry.--------422
Make me a captive, Lord,
And then I shall be free;
Force me to render up my sword,
And I shall conq'ror be.
I sink in life's alarms
When by myself I stand,
Imprisons me within Thy arms,
And strong shall be my hand.

My heart is weak and poor
Until it master find:
It has no spring of action sure,
It varies with the wind;
It cannot freely move
Till Thou hast wrought its chain;
Enslave it with Thy matchless love,
And deathless it shall reign.

My power is faint and low
Till I have learned to serve:
It wants the needed fire to glow,
It wants the breeze to nerve;
It cannot drive the world
Until itself be driven;
Its flag can only be unfurled
When Thou shalt breathe from heaven.

My will is not my own
Till Thou hast made it Thine;
If it would reach the monarch's throne
It must its crown resign;
It only stands unbent
Amid the clashing strife.
When on Thy bosom it has leant,
And found in Thee its life.--------423
Thou hidden love of God, whose height,
Whose depth unfathomed no man knows,
I see from far Thy beauteous light,
Inly I sigh for Thy repose;
My heart is pained, nor can it be
At rest, till it finds rest in Thee.

Thy secret voice invites me still
The sweetness of Thy yoke to prove;
And fain I would: but though my will
Seems fixed, yet wide my passion rove;
Yet hindrances strew all the way;
I aim at Thee, yet from Thee stray.

'Tis mercy all, that Thou hast brought
My mind to seek her peace in Thee;
Yet, while I seek but find Thee not,
No peace my wand'ring soul shall see.
Oh, when shall all my wand'rings end,
And all my steps to Thee-ward tend!

Is there a thing beneath the sun
That strives with Thee my heart to share?
Ah! Tear it thence, and reign alone,
The Lord of every motion there.
Then shall my heart from earth be free,
When it has found repose in Thee.

Oh, hide this self from me, that I
No more, but Christ in me may live;
My vile affections mortify,
Nor let one darling sin survive.
In all things nothing may I see,
Nothing desire or seek but Thee.

O Lord, Thy sovereign aid impart,
To save me from low-thoughted care;
Chase this self-will through all my heart,
Through all its latent mazes there.
Make me Thy duteous child, that I
Ceaseless may Abba, Father, cry.

Each moment draw from earth away
My heart which lowly waits Thy call;
Speak to my inmost soul and say.
"I am Thy Love, Thy God, Thy All."
To feel Thy power, to hear Thy voice,
To taste Thy love, be all my choice.--------424
Lord, I believe a rest remains
To all Thy people known;
A rest where pure enjoyment reigns,
And Thou art loved alone.

A rest, where all our soul's desire
Is fixed on things above;
Where fear and sin and grief expire,
Cast out by perfect love.

Oh, that I now the rest might know,
Believe, and enter in;
Now, Savior, now the power bestow,
And let me cease from sin.

Remove this hardness from my heart,
This unbelief remove;
To me the rest of faith impart,
The Sabbath of Thy love.

I would be Thine, Thou know'st I would,
And have Thee all my own;
Thee, O my all-sufficient Good.
I want, and Thee alone.--------425
Prince of peace, control my will;
Bid this struggling heart be still:
Bid my fears and doubtings cease:
Hush my spirit into peace.

Thou hast bought me with Thy blood,
Opened wide the gate to God;
Peace I ask, but peace must be,
Lord, in being one with Thee.

May Thy will, not mine be done;
May Thy will and mine be one;
Chase these doubtings from my heart,
Now Thy perfect peace impart.

Savior, at Thy feet I fall,
Thou, my life, my God, my all;
Let Thy happy servant be
One forevermore with Thee.--------426
Remove my covering, Lord,
That I may see Thy light,
And be deceived no more,
But all things see aright.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

I hardly know myself;
Deceived so much by pride,
I often think I'm right
And am self-satisfied.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

I know Thee even less;
In doctrine, shallowly;
True revelation lack
Of Thy reality.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

As for Thy life within,
In darkness I mistake
If spirit or the flesh,
One for the other take.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

As for Thy way, O Lord,
I often am not clear;
I toward seclusion tend
And from the pathway veer.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

As for Thy will for me,
I do not know it well;
I substitute my own
And often would rebel.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

As for the church, I need
Thy revelation more,
The Body-life to know,
Thy wisdom to explore.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.

I long to be unveiled,
In everything made clear,
No more to be deceived
Or to my pride adhere.

  Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
  Scatter all my night, Lord,
  And everything make bright, Lord,
  For this I pray to Thee.--------427
O Love divine, how sweet Thou art,
When shall I find my willing heart
All taken up by Thee?
My thirsty spirit faints to prove
The greatness of redeeming love,
The love of Christ to me.

Stronger His love than death and hell,
Its riches are unsearchable:
The first-born sons of light
Desire in vain its depths to see;
They cannot reach the mystery,
The length, and breadth, and height.

God only knows the love of God;
Oh, that it now were shed abroad
In this poor stony heart;
For love I sigh, for love I pine;
This only portion, Lord, be mine,
Be mine this better part.

Oh, that I could forever sit
Like Mary, at the Master's feet;
Be this my happy choice;
My only care, delight, and bliss,
My joy, my rest on earth be this,
To hear the Bridegroom's voice.--------428
O Lord, Thy boundless love to me
No thought can reach, no tongue declare;
Oh, knit my thankful heart to Thee,
And reign without a rival there;
Thine wholly, Thine alone I am;
Lord, with Thy love my heart inflame.

Oh, grant that nothing in my soul
May dwell but Thy pure love alone;
Oh, may Thy love possess me whole,
My joy, my treasure, and my crown;
All coldness from my heart remove;
May every act, word, thought, be love.

O Love, how cheering is Thy ray,
All pain before Thy presence flies;
Care, anguish, sorrow, melt away,
Where'er Thy healing beams arise;
Lord Jesus, nothing may I see,
And naught desire, or seek, but Thee.--------429
My faith looks up to Thee,
Thou Lamb of Calvary,
Savior Divine;
Now hear me while I pray;
Take all my guilt away;
Oh, let me from this day
Be wholly Thine.

May Thy rich grace impart
Strength to my fainting heart,
My zeal inspire;
As Thou hast died for me,
Oh, may my love to Thee
Pure, warm, and changeless be,
A living fire.

While life's dark maze I tread,
And griefs around me spread,
Be Thou my Guide;
Bid darkness turn to day,
Wipe sorrow's tears away,
Nor let me ever stray
From Thee aside.

All thru life's transient dream,
Until death's sullen stream
Shall o'er me roll,
Blest Savior, with Thy love,
Fear and distrust remove;
Make me Thy grace to prove,
Transform my soul.--------430
When I am in the natural man,
How very strong I feel I am,
I do not know, I cannot scan
How weak I am.

When in the world I have my life,
I cannot sense my failure rife,
But boasting in my earnest strife,
I forward press.

When I within the darkness dwell,
My shallow state I cannot tell,
I only think how I excel,
And proudly dream.

But when at last I come to Thee,
Thy searching light uncovers me,
I see what I could never see
My self exposed.

I wither 'neath Thy piercing ray,
And all my strength dissolves away,
My self-esteem in dust I lay,
And lowly bow.

How blind and foolish is the pride
With which my soul was fortified;
From my dark heart, self-satisfied,
It issued forth.

There's not a thing that pride can claim,
There's not a member but is lame,
There's only deep regret and shame,
How can I pray?

Thy blood from judgment saveth me,
Thy life from wrath delivers me,
How filthy yet in poverty
I really am.

I want to pray, but faith have not,
I fain would seek Thee as Thou art.
Oh, canst Thou e'er renew my heart,
Have mercy, Lord!--------431
Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me,
As some strong tide it presseth on its way,
Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul,
Yearning to sweep all barriers away.

Shall I not yield to that constraining power?
Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?
My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me,
Life cannot be as it hath hither been.

Break through my nature, mighty, heavenly love,
Clear every avenue of thought and brain,
Flood my affections, purify my will,
Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.

Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God,
Forth from my life, spontaneous and free,
Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace.
Loving, because God loved, eternally.--------432
O Love, that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

O Light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine's blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.

O Joy, that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.

O Cross, that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
I lay in dust life's glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.--------433
I am the Lord's! O joy beyond expression,
O sweet response to voice of love Divine;
Faith's joyous "Yes" to the assuring whisper,
"Fear not! I have redeemed thee; thou art Mine."

I am the Lord's! It is the glad confession
Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,
When love's "I will" accepted Him forever,
"The Lord's," to love, to honor and obey.

I am the Lord's! Yet teach me all it meaneth,
All it involves of love and loyalty,
Of holy service, absolute surrender,
And unreserved obedience unto Thee.

I am the Lord's! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,
O seal them irrecoverably Thine;
As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fulness
Forever and forevermore art mine.--------434
Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;
My heart by mighty grace compelled
Surrenders all to Thee;
Against Thy terrors long I strove,
But who can stand against Thy love?
Love conquers even me.

If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,
And light'nings flash, to blast my soul,
I still had stubborn been;
But mercy has my heart subdued,
A bleeding Savior I have viewed,
And now I hate my sin.

Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,
Come, take possession for Thine own,
For Thou hast set me free;
Released from Satan's hard command,
See all my powers waiting stand,
To be employed by Thee.--------435
Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,
That a time could ever be,
When I let the Savior's pity
Plead in vain, and proudly answered,
All of self, and none of Thee,
All of self, and none of Thee.

Yet He found me; I beheld Him
Bleeding on the cursd tree;
Heard Him pray, Forgive them, Father,
And my wistful heart said faintly,
Some of self, and some of Thee,
Some of self, and some of Thee.

Day by day His tender mercy,
Healing, helping, full and free,
Sweet and strong, and ah! So patient,
Brought me lower while I whispered,
Less of self, and more of Thee,
Less of self, and more of Thee.

Higher than the highest heavens,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered;
Grant me now my heart's petition,
None of self, and all of Thee,
None of self, and all of Thee.--------436
Thy Life was giv'n for me,
Thy blood, O Lord, was shed,
That I might ransomed be,
And quickened from the dead;
Thy Life was giv'n for me, for me;
What have I giv'n for Thee?

Long years were spent for me
In weariness and woe,
That through eternity
Thy glory I might know;
Long years were spent for me, for me;
Have I spent one for Thee?

Thy Father's home of light,
Thy rainbow-circled throne,
Were left for earthly night,
For wanderings sad and lone;
Yea, all was left for me, for me;
Have I left aught for Thee?

Thou, Lord, hast borne for me
More than my tongue can tell
Of bitterest agony,
To rescue me from hell;
Thou suff'redst all for me, for me;
What have I borne for Thee?

And Thou hast brought to me
Down from Thy home above
Salvation full and free,
Thy pardon and Thy love;
Great gifts, great gifts Thou broughtest me;
What have I brought to Thee?

Oh, let my life be given,
My years for Thee be spent;
World-fetters all be riven,
And joy with suff'ring blent;
Thou gav'st Thyself for me, for me,
I give myself to Thee.--------437
"Worthy tribute" (chorus line 2) may be replaced with "All our hearts' love".

Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?
Is not thine a captured heart?
Chief among ten thousand own Him;
Joyful choose the better part.

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
Lovely things of time and sense;
Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

What has stripped the seeming beauty
From the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
But the sight of peerless worth.

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

Not the crushing of those idols,
With its bitter void and smart;
But the beaming of His beauty,
The unveiling of His heart.

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

Who extinguishes their taper
Till they hail the rising sun?
Who discards the garb of winter
Till the summer has begun?

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

'Tis that look that melted Peter,
'Tis that face that Stephen saw,
'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
Can alone from idols draw:

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.

Draw and win and fill completely,
Till the cup o'erflow the brim;
What have we to do with idols
Who have companied with Him?

  Captivated by His beauty,
  Worthy tribute haste to bring;
  Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
  Crown Him now unrivaled King.--------438
I've turned my back upon the world
With all its idle pleasures,
And set my heart on better things,
On higher, holier treasures;
No more its glitter and its glare,
And vanity shall blind me;
I've crossed the separating line,
And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
I've crossed the separating line,
And left the world behind me.

I've left the old sad life of sin,
Its follies all forsaken;
My standing place is now in Christ,
His holy vows I've taken;
Beneath the standard of the cross
The world henceforth shall find me;
I've passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
I've passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.

My soul shall ne'er return again
Back to its former station,
For here alone is perfect peace,
And rest from condemnation;
I've made exchange of masters now,
The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I've left the world,
Yes, left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
And once for all I've left the world,
Yes, left the world behind me.

My choice is made forevermore,
I want no other Savior;
I ask no purer happiness
Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
No more the world shall blind me;
I've crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.

Far, far behind me!
Far, far behind me!
I've crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.--------439
Utterly abandoned
To the Holy Ghost!
Seeking all His fulness
At whatever cost;
Cutting all the shorelines,
Launching in the deep
Of His mighty power,
Strong to save and keep.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Utterly abandoned
To the Holy Ghost!
Oh! The sinking, sinking,
Till the self is lost!
Till the vessel's emptied
Broken at His feet;
Waiting till His filling
Makes the work complete.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Utterly abandoned
To the will of God;
Walking in the pathway
That my Master trod;
Leaving ease and pleasure;
Making Him my choice,
Waiting for His guidance,
Listening for His voice.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Utterly abandoned!
Through eternity;
My will never choosing,
His it e'er shall be;
All my plans and longings
Lost in His sweet will,
Having nothing, owning
All things in Him still.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Utterly abandoned!
'Tis so sweet to be
Captive in His love-bonds,
Yet so wondrous free;
Free from sin's dominion,
Free from doubt and fear,
Free from every worry,
Burden, grief or care.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Utterly abandoned!
Oh, the rest is sweet,
Waiting in His presence
At His blessed feet;
Waiting for the filling
Of the Host divine,
Who my inward parts shall
Perfectly refine.

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.

Lo! His Spirit fills me,
With His presence sweet!
I, in Him, am blessed!
I, in Him, complete!
Now, the light within me
Never shall grow dim
While abandoned ever,
Living unto Him!

  Utterly abandoned
  To the Lord of all,
  Seeking all His fulness,
  Answ'ring His dear call.--------440
Holy, happy separation!
They alone are truly blest
Who from all besides retiring,
And Himself alone desiring
Find in Jesus only rest,
Find in Jesus only rest.

Jesus calls to separation,
And Himself hath led the way;
His own life the explanation,
His own life the illustration
Who is ready to obey?
Who is ready to obey?

Blessed Jesus, make us willing,
Thus without the camp to go
Unto Thee in glad subjection,
Unto Thee in Thy rejection,
Unto Thee from all below,
Unto Thee from all below!

Separate from all that grieves Thee,
Separate from sinners too;
Yet, like Thee, for sinners caring,
And, like Thee, with sinners bearing,
Asking, "What would Jesus do?"
Asking, "What would Jesus do?"

Unto Thee! Beloved Master,
Nearer, nearer let us be;
Unto Thee in consecration,
Unto Thee in separation,
Ever, only, unto Thee,
Ever, only, unto Thee!--------441
All to Jesus, I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.

  I surrender all,
  I surrender all.
  All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

  I surrender all,
  I surrender all.
  All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

  I surrender all,
  I surrender all.
  All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

  I surrender all,
  I surrender all.
  All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.

All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame.
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!

  I surrender all,
  I surrender all.
  All to Thee, my blessed Savior,
  I surrender all.--------442
Fully surrendered  Lord, I would be,
Fully surrendered, dear Lord, to Thee.
All on the altar laid,
Surrender fully made,
Thou hast my ransom paid;
I yield to Thee.

Fully surrendered  life, time, and all,
All Thou hast given me held at Thy call.
Speak but the word to me,
Gladly I'll follow Thee,
Now and eternally
Obey my Lord.

Fully surrendered  silver and gold,
His, who hath given me riches untold.
All, all belong to Thee,
For Thou didst purchase me,
Thine evermore to be,
Jesus, my Lord.

Fully surrendered  Lord, I am Thine;
Fully surrendered, Savior divine!
Live Thou Thy life in me;
All fullness dwells in Thee;
Not I, but Christ in me,
Christ all in all.--------443
In full and glad surrender,
I give myself to Thee,
Thine utterly and only
And evermore to be.

O Son of God, who lov'st me,
I will be Thine alone;
And all I have and am, Lord,
Shall henceforth be Thine own!

Reign over me, Lord Jesus;
Oh, make my heart Thy throne;
It shall be Thine, dear Savior,
It shall be Thine alone.

Oh, come and reign, Lord Jesus,
Rule over everything!
And keep me always loyal,
And true to Thee, my King.--------444
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
All my being's ransomed pow'rs:
All my thoughts and words and doings,
All my days and all my hours.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
All my days and all my hours.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
All my days and all my hours.

Let my hands perform His bidding;
Let my feet run in His ways;
Let mine eyes see Jesus only;
Let my lips speak forth His praise.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Let my lips speak forth His praise.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Let my lips speak forth His praise.

Worldlings prize their gems of beauty,
Cling to gilded toys of dust;
Boast of wealth, and fame, and pleasure;
Only Jesus will I trust.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Only Jesus will I trust.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Only Jesus will I trust.

Since mine eyes were fixed on Jesus,
I've lost sight of all beside
So enchained my spirit's vision,
Looking at the Crucified.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Looking at the Crucified.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Looking at the Crucified.

Oh, what wonder! How amazing!
Jesus, glorious King of kings,
Deigns to call me His beloved,
Lets me rest beneath His wings.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Resting now beneath His wings.
All for Jesus! All for Jesus!
Resting now beneath His wings.--------445
Take my life, and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee,
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee,
Filled with messages from Thee.

Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose,
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart; it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure-store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee,
Ever, only, all for Thee.--------446
What shall I give Thee, Master?
Thou who didst die for me.
Shall I give less of what I possess,
Or shall I give all to Thee?

  Jesus, my Lord and Savior;
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Thou didst leave Thy home above
  To die on Calvary.
  What shall I give Thee, Master?
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Not just a part or half of my heart,
  I will give all to Thee.

What shall I give Thee, Master?
Thou hast redeemed my soul;
My gift is small but it is my all
Surrendered to Thy control.

  Jesus, my Lord and Savior;
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Thou didst leave Thy home above
  To die on Calvary.
  What shall I give Thee, Master?
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Not just a part or half of my heart,
  I will give all to Thee.

What shall I give Thee, Master?
Giver of gifts divine!
I will not hold time, talents or gold
For everything shall be Thine.

  Jesus, my Lord and Savior;
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Thou didst leave Thy home above
  To die on Calvary.
  What shall I give Thee, Master?
  Thou hast giv'n all for me;
  Not just a part or half of my heart,
  I will give all to Thee.--------447
My spirit, soul, and body,
Dear Lord, I give to Thee,
A consecrated offering,
Thine evermore to be.

  My all is on the altar;
  Lord, I am all Thine own;
  Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
  Lord, keep me Thine alone.

Lord Jesus, mighty Savior,
I trust in Thy great name;
I look for Thy salvation,
Thy promise now I claim.

  My all is on the altar;
  Lord, I am all Thine own;
  Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
  Lord, keep me Thine alone.

Now, Lord, I yield my members,
From sin's dominion free,
For warfare and for triumph,
As weapons unto Thee.

  My all is on the altar;
  Lord, I am all Thine own;
  Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
  Lord, keep me Thine alone.

Oh, blissful self-surrender,
To live, my Lord, by Thee;
Now, Son of God, my Savior,
Live out Thy life in me.

  My all is on the altar;
  Lord, I am all Thine own;
  Oh, may my faith ne'er falter!
  Lord, keep me Thine alone.

I'm Thine, O dear Lord Jesus,
Washed in Thy precious blood,
Sealed by Thy Holy Spirit,
A sacrifice to God.

  My all is on the altar;
  I'm waiting for the fire;
  I'm waiting, waiting, waiting;
  I'm waiting for the fire.--------448
You have longed for sweet peace, and for faith to increase,
And have earnestly, fervently prayed;
But you cannot have rest, or be perfectly blest,
Until all on the altar is laid.

  Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
  Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
  You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
  As you yield Him your body and soul.

Would you walk with the Lord in the light of His Word,
And have peace and contentment alway;
You must do His sweet will to be free from all ill;
On the altar you all you must lay.

  Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
  Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
  You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
  As you yield Him your body and soul.

Oh, we never can know what the Lord will bestow
Of the blessings for which we have prayed,
Till our body and soul He doth fully control,
And our all on the altar is laid.

  Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
  Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
  You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
  As you yield Him your body and soul.

Who can tell all the love He will send from above!
Oh, how happy our heart will be made!
Oh, what fellowship sweet we shall share at His feet,
When our all on the altar is laid!

  Is your all on the altar of sacrifice laid?
  Your, heart, does the Spirit control?
  You can only be blest and have peace and sweet rest,
  As you yield Him your body and soul.--------449
Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Thou art the Potter,
I am the clay.
Mould me and make me
After Thy will,
While I am waiting,
Yielded and still.

Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Search me and try me,
Master, today.
Whiter than snow, Lord,
Wash me just now,
As in Thy presence
Humbly I bow.

Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Wounded and weary,
Help me, I pray.
Power, all power,
Surely is Thine,
Touch me and heal me,
Savior divine.

Have Thine own way, Lord,
Have Thine own way;
Hold o'er my being
Absolute sway.
Fill with Thy Spirit
Till all shall see
Christ only, always,
Living in me.--------450
Lie still, and let Him mould thee!
Oh, Lord, I would obey;
Be Thou the skillful, Potter,
And I the yielding clay.

  Bend me, oh, bend me to Thy will,
  While in Thy hand I'm lying still.

In Thy dear hand I'm resting,
Oh, hold me quiet there;
Then soften me and mould me,
And for Thy will prepare.

  Bend me, oh, bend me to Thy will,
  While in Thy hand I'm lying still.

I need not fear to trust Thee,
Thy love and skill are such,
New lessons Thou wilt teach me,
While yielding to Thy touch.

  Bend me, oh, bend me to Thy will,
  While in Thy hand I'm lying still.

Impress Thine image on me,
Fulfill Thy blest design,
Till others see upon me
That beauteous face of Thine.

  Bend me, oh, bend me to Thy will,
  While in Thy hand I'm lying still.--------451
Not by wrestling, but by clinging
Shall we be most blest;
Wrestling only brings us sorrow;
Clinging brings us rest.

When we stay our feeble efforts,
And from struggling cease,
Unconditional surrender
Brings us God's own peace.

Lean we all our weight on Jesus,
Who alone can save;
He by might of love hath triumphed
O'er His willing slave.

Yielding, we shall know true conquest;
Dying, we shall live;
"Not my will, but Thine" prevaileth,
Victory to give.--------452
Tell me not of earthly pleasures,
Tempt me not with sordid gain;
Mock me not with earth's illusions,
Vex me not with honors vain.
I am weaned from sinful idols;
I am henceforth not my own;
I have given my heart to Jesus,
I belong to Him alone.

  I am not my own,
  I am not my own.
  I belong to Jesus,
  And I am not my own.

Oh, the blessed rest it brings us
To belong to Christ alone;
We can draw on all His fulness
When we've nothing of our own.
Blessed Jesus, take me, own me,
Make me, keep me wholly Thine.
Deign to find in me Thy portion,
While I joy to call Thee mine.

  I am not my own,
  I am not my own.
  I belong to Jesus,
  And I am not my own.

Weary soul, give up the struggle,
Cease at length thyself to own;
Give yourself away to Jesus,
And belong to Him alone.
Once He gave His all to win thee,
Now He asks as much of thee;
All He has He fully gives thee;
Let thy love His portion be.

  I am not my own,
  I am not my own.
  I belong to Jesus,
  And I am not my own.--------453
Under an eastern sky,
Amid a rabble's cry,
A Man went forth to die,
For me! For me!

Thorn-crowned His blessed head,
Blood-stained His every tread;
Cross-laden He was led,
For me! For me!

Pierced His hands and feet,
Three hours o'er Him beat
Fierce rays of noon-tide heat,
For me! For me!

Thus wert Thou made all mine;
Lord, make me wholly Thine;
Grant grace and strength divine
To me! To me!

In thought and word and deed,
Thy will to do, O lead
My soul, e'en though it bleed,
To Thee, to Thee.--------454
I lift my heart to Thee,
Savior Divine,
For Thou art all to me,
And I am Thine;
Is there on earth a closer bond than this,
That my Beloved's mine, and I am His?

Thine am I by all ties,
And chiefly Thine,
For through Thy sacrifice
Thou, Lord, art mine;
By Thine own cords of love, so sweetly wound
Around me, closely I to Thee am bound.

To Thee, Thou Bleeding Lamb,
I all things owe,
All that I have and am,
And all I know;
All that I have is now no longer mine,
And I am not my own: Lord, I am Thine.

How can I, Lord, withhold
Life's brightest hour
From Thee; or gathered gold,
Or any power?
Why should I keep one precious thing from Thee,
When Thou hast given Thine own dear Self to me?

I pray Thee, Savior, keep
Me in Thy love,
Until the world Thou sweep
And me remove
To that fair realm, where, sin and sorrow o'er,
Thou and Thine own are one for evermore.--------455
Every thread I wind this day,
Every footstep on life's way,
Every clod I shall unearth,
Every task, whate'er its worth:
Only for God's glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!

All the burdens of the day,
All the words which I shall say,
All the works my God may send,
All the hours in rest I spend:
Ever for His glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!

Every blood-drop in the heart,
Every grief and aching smart,
Every bitter pulse of pain,
Every hour of joy again:
Only for God's glory living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!

All, from deeds of little worth,
To the greatest things on earth;
Mine to build some world to be,
Or to lie and gaze on Thee:
For Thy glory daily living,
Blessing, praise and honor giving!--------456
Living for Jesus a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do;
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.

  O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
  I give myself to Thee,
  For Thou, in Thy redemption,
  Didst give Thyself for me;
  I own no other Master,
  My heart shall be Thy throne,
  My life I give, henceforth to live,
  O Christ, for Thee alone.

Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calv'ry my sin and disgrace;
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

  O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
  I give myself to Thee,
  For Thou, in Thy redemption,
  Didst give Thyself for me;
  I own no other Master,
  My heart shall be Thy throne,
  My life I give, henceforth to live,
  O Christ, for Thee alone.

Living for Jesus wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His holy name;
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

  O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
  I give myself to Thee,
  For Thou, in Thy redemption,
  Didst give Thyself for me;
  I own no other Master,
  My heart shall be Thy throne,
  My life I give, henceforth to live,
  O Christ, for Thee alone.

Living for Jesus through earth's little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.

  O Jesus, Lord and Savior,
  I give myself to Thee,
  For Thou, in Thy redemption,
  Didst give Thyself for me;
  I own no other Master,
  My heart shall be Thy throne,
  My life I give, henceforth to live,
  O Christ, for Thee alone.--------457
My life, my love, I give to Thee,
Thou Lamb of God who died for me;
Oh, may I ever faithful be,
My Savior and my God!

  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  How happy then my life shall be!
  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  My Savior and my God!

The world and all its joys I leave;
My life, O Lord, Thou wilt receive;
Henceforth no more Thyself I'll grieve,
My Savior and my God!

  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  How happy then my life shall be!
  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  My Savior and my God!

O Thou who died on Calvary,
To save my soul and make me free,
That I may ever live for Thee
My Savior and my God!

  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  How happy then my life shall be!
  I'll live for Him who died for me,
  My Savior and my God!--------458
Living for Jesus, oh, what peace!
Rivers of pleasure never cease;
Trials may come, yet I'll not fear,
Living for Jesus, He is near.

  Help me to serve Thee more and more,
  Help me to praise Thee o'er and o'er;
  Live in Thy presence day by day,
  Never to turn from Thee away.

Living for Jesus, oh, what rest!
Pleasing my Savior, I am blest;
Only to live for Him alone,
Doing His will till life is done.

  Help me to serve Thee more and more,
  Help me to praise Thee o'er and o'er;
  Live in Thy presence day by day,
  Never to turn from Thee away.

Living for Jesus, everywhere,
All of my burdens He doth bear;
Friends may forsake me, He'll be true;
Trusting in Him, He'll guide me through.

  Help me to serve Thee more and more,
  Help me to praise Thee o'er and o'er;
  Live in Thy presence day by day,
  Never to turn from Thee away.

Living for Jesus, till at last
Into His glory I have passed;
There to behold Him on His throne,
Hear from His lips, "My child, well done!"

  Help me to serve Thee more and more,
  Help me to praise Thee o'er and o'er;
  Live in Thy presence day by day,
  Never to turn from Thee away.--------459
Not to ourselves again,
Not to flesh we live;
Not to world henceforth shall we
Our strength, our being give.

The time past of our lives
Sufficeth to have wrought
The fleshly will, which only ill
Hath to us ever brought.

No longer is our life
A thing unused or vain;
To us e'en here to live is Christ,
To us to die is gain.

Our life is hid with Christ,
With Christ in God above,
Upward our heart would go to Him,
Whom, seeing not, we love.

He liveth, and we live!
His life for us prevails;
His fulness fills our mighty void,
His strength for us avails.--------460

Jesus, I my cross have taken,
All to leave and follow Thee;
Destitute, despised, forsaken,
Thou, from hence, my all shalt be.
Perish every fond ambition,
All I've sought, and hoped, and known;
Yet how rich is my condition,
God and Christ are still my own!

Let the world despise and leave me,
They have left my Savior, too;
Human hearts and looks deceive me;
Thou art not, like man, untrue;
And, while Thou shalt smile upon me,
God of wisdom, love, and might,
Foes may hate, and friends disown me;
Show Thy face, and all is bright.

Man may trouble and distress me,
'Twill but drive me to Thy breast;
Life with trials hard may press me,
Christ will bring me sweeter rest.
O 'tis not in grief to harm me,
While Thy love is left to me;
O 'twere not in joy to charm me,
Were that joy unmixed with Thee.

Haste thee on from grace to glory,
Armed by faith and winged by prayer;
God's eternal day's before thee,
God's own hand shall guide thee there.
Soon shall close thy earthly mission,
Swift shall pass thy pilgrim days,
Hope shall change to glad fruition,
Faith to sight, and prayer to praise.Versions: 1 | 2

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the flowers are blooming and the
sweet waters flow;
Everywhere He leads me I would follow,
follow on,
Walking in His footsteps till the crown be
won.

  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!

Down in the valley with my Savior I would go,
Where the storms are sweeping and the
dark waters flow;
With His hand to lead me I will never,
never fear,
Dangers cannot fright me if my Lord is near.

  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!

Down in the valley, or upon the mountain steep,
Close beside my Savior would my heart ever keep;
He will lead me safely in the path that He has trod,
Up to where they gather in the rest of God.

  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Anywhere, everywhere, I would follow on!
  Follow! Follow! I would follow Jesus!
  Everywhere He leads me I would follow on!--------462
How shall I follow Him I serve?
How shall I copy Him I love?
Nor from those blessed footsteps swerve,
Which lead me to His seat above?

Privations, sorrows, bitter scorn,
The life of toil, the mean abode,
The faithless kiss, the crown of thorn
Are these the consecrated road?

Lord, should my path through suff'ring lie,
Forbid it I should e'er repine;
Still let me turn to Calvary,
Nor heed my griefs, rememb'ring Thine.

O let me think how Thou didst leave
Untasted every pure delight,
To fast, to faint, to watch, to grieve,
The toilsome day, the homeless night:

To faint, to grieve, to die for me!
Thou camest, not Thyself to please;
And, dear as earthly comforts be,
Shall I not love Thee more than these?--------463
I love, I love my Master,
I will not go out free,
For He is my Redeemer;
He paid the price for me.
I would not leave His service,
It is so sweet and blest;
And in the weariest moments
He gives the truest rest.

My Master shed His life-blood
My vassal life to win,
And save me from the bondage
Of tyrant self and sin.
He chose me for His service,
And gave me power to choose
That blessed, perfect freedom,
Which I shall never lose.

I would not halve my service,
His only it must be!
His only, who so loved me,
And gave Himself for me.
Rejoicing and adoring,
Henceforth my song shall be,
I love, I love my Master,
I will not go out free.--------464
My glorious Victor, Prince Divine,
Clasp these surrendered hands in Thine;
At length my will is all Thine own,
Glad vassal of a Savior's throne.

My Master, lead me to Thy door;
Pierce this now willing ear once more;
Thy bonds are freedom; let me stay
With Thee, to toil, endure, obey.

Yes, ear and hand, and thought and will,
Use all in Thy dear slav'ry still!
Self's weary liberties I cast
Beneath Thy feet; there keep them fast.

Tread them still down; and then I know,
These hands shall with Thy gifts o'erflow;
And piercd ears shall hear the tone
Which tells me Thou and I are one.--------465
O Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Be Thou forever near me,
My Master and my Friend;
I shall not fear the battle
If Thou art by my side,
Nor wander from the pathway
If Thou wilt be my Guide.

Oh, let me feel Thee near me;
The world is ever near;
I see the sights that dazzle,
The tempting sounds I hear;
My foes are ever near me,
Around me and within;
But, Jesus, draw Thou nearer,
And shield my soul from sin.

Oh, let me hear Thee speaking,
In accents clear and still,
Above the storms of passion,
The murmurs of self-will;
Oh, speak to reassure me,
To hasten, or control;
Oh, speak, and make me listen,
Thou Guardian of my soul.

O Jesus, Thou hast promised
To all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory
There shall Thy servant be;
And, Jesus, I have promised
To serve Thee to the end;
Oh, give me grace to follow,
My Master and my Friend.

Oh, let me see Thy footmarks,
And in them plant mine own;
My hope to follow duly
Is in Thy strength alone.
Oh, guide me, call me, draw me,
Uphold me to the end;
And then to rest receive me,
My Savior and my Friend.--------466
He has entered! He has entered!
Every guest may now depart;
He has taken all the chamber
Of my once divided heart.

He has entered! He has entered!
Vanish every doubt and sin;
He has taken full possession,
He is Lord of all within.

Long at my poor heart He tarried,
Knocking with His wounded hand;
Wide at last to Him I opened,
Yielding all to His command.

He has entered! He has entered!
Every sorrow now must flee;
Where He reigns as King and Master,
There no grief can ever be.--------467
This day the Lord has spoken,
This day my choice is made:
I will be all for Jesus,
Who all for me has paid.

Now His shall be the empire,
In all things over me;
And I will be His bond slave,
Yet gloriously free.

From henceforth, owning nothing,
I cannot lose at all;
I cannot well be poorer,
Whatever may befall.

Yet could I not be richer,
If I the world should gain;
For heav'n and earth shall perish,
But Jesus will remain.

And He will be my treasure,
And He my boundless store;
And those who live on Jesus,
Will never hunger more.

Though I am utter weakness,
In Him I shall prevail;
And though my love may falter,
Yet His will never fail.--------468
Am I a soldier of the Cross
A follower of the Lamb?
And shall I fear to own His cause,
Or blush to speak His name?

  In the name, the precious name,
  Of Him who died for me,
  Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
  Whate'er my cross may be.

Must I be carried to the skies
On flowery beds of ease,
While others fought to win the prize
And sailed through bloody seas?

  In the name, the precious name,
  Of Him who died for me,
  Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
  Whate'er my cross may be.

Are there no foes for me to face?
Must I not stem the flood?
Is this vile world a friend to grace,
To help me on to God?

  In the name, the precious name,
  Of Him who died for me,
  Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
  Whate'er my cross may be.

Since I must fight if I would reign,
Increase my courage, Lord!
I'll bear the toil, endure the pain,
Supported by Thy Word.

  In the name, the precious name,
  Of Him who died for me,
  Through grace I'll win the promised crown,
  Whate'er my cross may be.--------469
Who is on the Lord's side?
Who will serve the King?
Who will be His helpers,
Other lives to bring?
Who will leave the world's side?
Who will face the foe?
Who is on Lord's side?
Who for Him will go?

  By Thy grand redemption,
  By Thy grace divine,
  We are on the Lord's side;
  Savior, we are Thine.

Not for weight of glory,
Not for crown and palm,
Enter we the army,
Raise the warrior psalm;
But for love that claimeth
Lives for whom He died;
He whom Jesus nameth
Must be on His side.

  By Thy grand redemption,
  By Thy grace divine,
  We are on the Lord's side;
  Savior, we are Thine.

Jesus, Thou hast bought us,
Not with gold or gem,
But with Thine own life-blood,
For Thy diadem;
With Thy blessing filling
Each who comes to Thee,
Thou hast made us willing,
Thou hast made us free.

  By Thy grand redemption,
  By Thy grace divine,
  We are on the Lord's side;
  Savior, we are Thine.

Fierce may be the conflict,
Strong may be the foe,
But the King's own army
None can overthrow.
Round His standard ranging
Victory is secure,
For His truth unchanging
Makes the triumph sure.

  By Thy grand redemption,
  By Thy grace divine,
  We are on the Lord's side;
  Savior, we are Thine.

Chosen to be soldiers
In an alien land:
Chosen, called, and faithful,
For our Captain's band;
In the service royal
Let us not grow cold;
Let us be right loyal,
Noble, true, and bold.

  By Thy grand redemption,
  By Thy grace divine,
  We are on the Lord's side;
  Savior, we are Thine.--------470
Father, Son and Holy Ghost,
One in Three, and Three in One,
As by the celestial host,
Let Thy will on earth be done;
Praise by all to Thee be giv'n,
Glorious Lord of earth and heav'n!

Vilest of the sinful race,
Lo, I answer to Thy call:
Meanest vessel of Thy grace,
Grace divinely free for all;
Lo, I come to do Thy will,
All Thy counsel to fulfill.

If so poor a worm as I,
May to Thy great glory live,
All my actions sanctify,
All my words and thoughts receive;
Claim me for Thy service, claim
All I have, and all I am.

Take my soul and body's powers,
Take my mem'ry, mind, and will;
All my goods and all my hours,
All I know, and all I feel;
All I think, or speak, or do;
Take my heart, but make it new.

Now, O God, Thine own I am,
Now I give Thee back Thine own:
Freedom, friends, and health, and fame,
Consecrate to Thee alone;
Thine I live, thrice happy I;
Happier still when Thine I die.--------471
How can I ever stay away
And grieve Thy Spirit all the day
While Thou dost wait for me?
I now am willing to return,
And wait no longer, for I yearn
Henceforth to follow Thee.

I offer now without reserve
All that I am and all I have
Thy purpose to fulfill.
Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,
That henceforth I may only seek
To do the Father's will.

When I look back, what grief and shame
That I've brought none to trust Thy name,
Thy word I've locked within.
Oh, may the Lord anointing give
And richly through my being live,
That I may speak of Him.

My gracious Lord has giv'n much grace,
Exceeding e'en a friend my place;
I fain would be His bride.
I'd share His life and suffer loss,
Accepting willingly the cross,
With Him identified.--------472
Many crowd the Savior's kingdom,
Few receive His cross;
Many seek His consolation,
Few will suffer loss.
For the dear sake of the Master,
Counting all but dross,
For the dear sake of the Master,
Counting all but dross.

Many sit at Jesus' table,
Few will fast with Him,
When the sorrow-cup of anguish
Trembles to the brim.
Few watch with Him in the garden,
Who have sung the hymn,
Few watch with Him in the garden,
Who have sung the hymn.

Many will confess His wisdom,
Few embrace His shame.
Many, should He smile upon them,
Will His praise proclaim;
Then, if for a while He leave them,
They desert His name,
Then, if for a while He leave them,
They desert His name.

But the souls who love Him truly,
Let woe come or bliss,
These will count their dearest hearts' blood
Not their own, but His.
Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
Give me love like this,
Savior, Thou who thus hast loved me,
Give me love like this.--------473
No mortal tongue can e'er describe
The freedom of the soul,
When passed beyond all earthly bribe
To God's complete control.
All things are his, yes, life, and death,
Things present or to come;
In Christ he draws in peace each breath,
In Christ he finds his home.

When such as we the King can choose,
To share with Him His throne,
'Tis passing strange that we refuse
To be our Lord's alone.
O never speak of sacrifice!
A privilege untold
Is to be His at any price,
In Calv'ry's hosts enrolled.

Arise! The holy bargain strike
The fragment for the whole
All men and all events alike
Must serve the ransomed soul.
All things are yours when you are His,
And He and you are one;
A boundless life in Him there is,
Whence doubt and fear are gone.--------474
I am one with Thee, Lord Jesus,
One in spirit now with Thee;
All Thyself I now possess, Lord,
All Thou art now lives in me.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.

Now I share Thy human life, Lord,
Filled with Thy humanity,
All of Thy complete obedience
Is available to me.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.

One with Thee in crucifixion,
On the cross I died in Thee;
I am dead unto the world, Lord,
And the world is dead to me.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.

One with Thee in resurrection,
Risen now to live in Thee,
With that life which is Thyself, Lord,
Now in me, Lord, even me.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.

One with Thee in Thine ascension,
In the heavens now with Thee;
Here a pilgrim and a stranger,
My true life is hid in Thee.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.

One with Thee in Thine enthronement,
Sharing Thine authority,
Even as I share Thy life, Lord,
I in Thee and Thou in me.

  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  One with Thee, one with Thee.
  Day by day I share Thy riches,
  Thou art everything to me.--------475
One with Thee, Thou Son eternal,
Joined by faith in spirit one,
Share we in Thy death inclusive
And Thy life, O God the Son.
One with Thee, Thou Son beloved,
Part of Thee become thru grace,
Heirs with Thee of our one Father,
We're Thy Spirit's dwelling place.

One with Thee, Thou Son incarnate,
Born with Thee, the Man of worth,
We, the members of Thy body,
Sojourn with Thee here on earth.
One with Thee, Thou Son anointed,
Sharing too the Spirit's power,
We in full cooperation
Labor with Thee hour by hour.

One with Thee, Thou Son forsaken,
Judgment and the curse we've passed;
We to sin are dead forever,
Hell beneath our feet is cast.
One with Thee in resurrection,
Death can never us oppress;
Live we in Thy new creation,
Bearing fruits of righteousness.

One with Thee, Thou Son ascended,
Seated with Thee on the throne,
Thine authority we share and
Rule with Thee, Thy rank our own.
One with Thee, Thou Son returning,
Glorified with Thee we'll be,
E'er to manifest Thy beauty,
One with Thee eternally.--------476
Oh, sacred union with the Perfect Mind,
Transcendent bliss which Thou alone canst give;
How blest are they this Peerless One who find,
And, dead to earth, have learned in Thee to live.

Thus in Thine arms of love, O Christ, I live,
Lost, and forever lost to all but Thee.
My happy soul, since it hath learned to die,
Hath found new life in Thine Infinity.

Go, then, and learn this lesson of the Cross,
And tread the way that saints and prophets trod:
Who, counting life and self and all things loss,
Have found in inward death the life of God.--------477
Though Christ a thousand times
In Bethlehem be born,
If He's not born in thee
Thy soul is still forlorn.
The Cross on Golgotha,
Will never save thy soul;
The Cross in thine own heart,
Alone can make thee whole,

  O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
  Into this heart of mine,
  That I to my own self may die
  And rise to thy life Divine.

What e'er thou lovest, man,
That too become thou must;
God, if thou lovest God,
Dust, if thou lovest dust.
Go out, God will come in;
Die thou and let Him live;
Be not and He will be;
Wait and He'll all things give.

  O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
  Into this heart of mine,
  That I to my own self may die
  And rise to thy life Divine.

To bring thee to thy God,
Love takes the shortest route;
The way which knowledge leads,
Is but a roundabout.
Drive out from thee the world,
And then thy heart shall be
Filled with the love of God,
And holy like as He.

  O, Cross of Christ, I take thee
  Into this heart of mine,
  That I to my own self may die
  And rise to thy life Divine.--------478
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Once I stood in condemnation,
Waiting thus the sinner's doom;
Christ in death has wrought salvation,
God has raised Him from the tomb.
Once I was to God a stranger,
Filled with enmity and fear;
He has rescued me from danger,
Love revealed and brought me near.

Now I see in Christ's acceptance
But the measure of my own;
He who lay beneath my sentence,
Seated high upon the Throne.
Quickened, raised, and in Him seated,
I a full deliverance know;
Every foe has been defeated,
Every enemy laid low.

Now I have a life in union
With the risen Lord above;
Now I drink in sweet communion
Some rich foretaste of His love.
Soon, O Lord! In highest glory,
All its vastness I'll explore;
Soon I'll cast my crown before Thee,
While I worship and adore.--------479
Oh, what a wonderful place
Jesus has given to me!
Saved by His glorious grace,
I may be even as He.
When with my Lord I appear,
Like Him I know I shall be;
But while I walk with Him here,
I may be even as He.

  Even as He, even as He,
  Wonderful words that even we,
  Saved by His marvelous grace may be
  One with the Savior, even as He.

One in His death on the tree,
One as He rose from the dead;
I from the curse am as free
E'en as my glorious Head.
One on the throne by His side,
One in His sonship divine;
One as the bride-groom and the bride,
One as the branch and the vine.

  Even as He, even as He,
  Wonderful words that even we,
  Saved by His marvelous grace may be
  One with the Savior, even as He.

One in His merits I stand,
One as I pray in His name;
All that His worth can command,
I can with confidence claim.
One in His faith and His love,
One in His life I may be.
Sealed by the heavenly Dove,
I may be holy as He.

  Even as He, even as He,
  Wonderful words that even we,
  Saved by His marvelous grace may be
  One with the Savior, even as He.--------480
Joined unto Christ the Conqueror,
His Calv'ry triumph, too,
Assures me in the darkest hour
That He will take me through.

Joined unto Christ the risen Lord,
Triumphant now above;
The glory of His cross reveals
Magnificence of love.

Joined unto Christ's full victory,
Magnificently free;
Declare it in the conquering name,
And powers of darkness flee.

Joined unto Christ! Magnificent!
His wondrous Calvary plan,
Draws us through ages to adore;
For "Worthy is the Lamb."--------481
Crucified with Christ my Savior,
To the world and self and sin;
To the death-born life of Jesus
I am sweetly ent'ring in:
In His fellowship of suff'ring,
To His death conformed to be,
I am going with my Savior
All the way to Calvary.

  All the way to Calvary,
  Where my Savior went for me,
  Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
  All the way to Calvary.

'Tis not hard to die with Christ
When His risen life we know;
'Tis not hard to share His suff'rings
When our hearts with joy o'erflow.
In His resurrection power
He has come to dwell in me,
And my heart is gladly going
All the way to Calvary.

  All the way to Calvary,
  Where my Savior went for me,
  Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
  All the way to Calvary.

If we die we'll live with Christ,
If we suffer we shall reign;
Only thus the prize of glory
Can the conqueror attain.
Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning
Should the Master say to thee,
"Yes, my child, thou didst go with me
All the way to Calvary."

  All the way to Calvary,
  Where my Savior went for me,
  Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
  All the way to Calvary.--------482
I am crucified with Christ,
And the cross hath set me free;
I have ris'n again with Christ,
And He lives and reigns in me.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.

Mystery hid from ancient ages!
But at length to faith made plain:
Christ in me the Hope of Glory,
Tell it o'er and o'er again.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.

This the secret nature hideth,
Harvest grows from buried grain;
A poor tree with better grafted,
Richer, sweeter life doth gain.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.

This the secret of the holy,
Not our holiness, but Him;
O Lord! Empty us and fill us,
With Thy fulness to the brim.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.

This the balm for pain and sickness,
Just to all our strength to die,
And to find His life and fulness,
All our being's need supply.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.

This the story of the Master,
Thru the Cross, He reached the Throne,
And like Him our path to glory,
Ever leads through death alone.

  Oh! It is so sweet to die with Christ,
  To the world, and self, and sin;
  Oh! It is so sweet to live with Christ,
  As He lives and reigns within.--------483
Buried with Christ, and raised with Him too;
What is there left for me to do?
Simply to cease from struggling and strife,
Simply to walk in newness of life.
Glory be to God!

Risen with Christ, my glorious Head,
Holiness now the pathway I tread,
Beautiful thought, while walking therein:
He that is dead is freed from sin.
Glory be to God!

Living with Christ, who dieth no more,
Following Christ, who goeth before;
I am from bondage utterly freed,
Reckoning self as dead indeed.
Glory be to God!

Living for Christ, my members I yield,
Servants to God, for evermore sealed,
Not under law, I'm now under grace,
Sin is dethroned, and Christ takes its place.
Glory be to God!

Growing in Christ; no more shall be named
Thing of which now I'm truly ashamed,
Fruit unto holiness will I bear,
Life evermore, the end I shall share.
Glory be to God!--------484
When Christ once died on Calvary,
I too was there;
'Twas in my place He stood for me,
And now accepted e'en as He,
His name I bear.

  I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
  Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
  And the life I live in the flesh,
  I live by the faith of the Son of God,
  Who loved, and gave Himself for me.

When Christ once rose with life divine,
I too was there;
His resurrection pow'r is mine,
And as the branches and the vine
His life I share.

  I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
  Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
  And the life I live in the flesh,
  I live by the faith of the Son of God,
  Who loved, and gave Himself for me.

When Christ will come some day for me,
I shall be there;
With Him and like Him I shall be,
And all His glorious majesty
I too shall share.

  I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
  Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
  And the life I live in the flesh,
  I live by the faith of the Son of God,
  Who loved, and gave Himself for me.

O blessed life so deep, so high,
Lord, keep me there;
Help me with Christ to live, to die,
And let me with Him, bye and bye
His glory share.

  I am crucified with Christ, nevertheless I live,
  Yet, not I, but Christ who liveth in me;
  And the life I live in the flesh,
  I live by the faith of the Son of God,
  Who loved, and gave Himself for me.--------485
What great provision God has made
In Jesus' death on Calvary!
I hung with Him upon the tree,
And in His tomb I too was laid.

I rose with Him from out the grave
And how shall I who died to sin
Continue still to live therein,
The victor living as the slave?

At God's right hand He took His place,
And while for saints my Savior pleads,
My heart for sinners intercedes
That they might know His saving grace.

Oh, what a name to me is given
A son of God, by second birth!
I represent Him on the earth,
He represents me now in heaven.

As Jesus dwells beyond the skies,
I dwell within this world of strife;
And as He lives within my life,
In Him I'm in the heavenlies!--------486
Dying with Jesus, by death reckoned mine;
Living with Jesus a new life divine;
Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine,
Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

  Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
  Moment by moment I've life from above;
  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a battle with wrong for the right,
Never a contest that He doth not fight;
Lifting above us His banner so white;
Moment by moment I'm kept in His sight.

  Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
  Moment by moment I've life from above;
  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a trial that He is not there,
Never a burden that He doth not bear;
Never a sorrow that He doth not share,
Moment by moment, I'm under His care.

  Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
  Moment by moment I've life from above;
  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a heartache, and never a groan,
Never a teardrop, and never a moan;
Never a danger but there on the throne
Moment by moment He thinks of His own.

  Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
  Moment by moment I've life from above;
  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.

Never a weakness that He doth not feel,
Never a sickness that He cannot heal;
Moment by moment, in woe or in weal,
Jesus, my Savior, abides with me still.

  Moment by moment I'm kept in His love,
  Moment by moment I've life from above;
  Looking to Jesus till glory doth shine;
  Moment by moment, O Lord, I am Thine.--------487
What a wondrous fact, I'm crucified with Christ;
Of my flesh and passion I'm relieved;
What a glorious fact, with Christ, the Lord, I live,
Resurrected life in Him received.

  On the Cross of Calvary the Lord and I
  Were crucified, were crucified;
  Now in resurrection life with Him I live
  And in Him e'er abide.--------488
Lord, Thou hast shown the mystery,
How on the Cross I died with Thee;
I need no other pow'r or way
That I may triumph day by day.

That cross of Thine is also mine,
Into my life its light doth shine;
When I believe I'm dead with Thee,
The world has lost it pow'r o'er me.

Since I am crucified with Thee,
From sin and self I am set free;
How can I still enjoy the world
Or seek its vanities unfurled?

I take my place, dear Lord, with Thee
Upon the cross of Calvary.
Thy life and power then are mine,
Since Thou and I in oneness twine.

Since Thou didst come to slay the foe,
His work and power to overthrow,
I too can overcome in Thee
And prove Thy mighty pow'r in me.

Yet, for the vict'ry we rely
Upon the death which Thou didst die;
We tread the path which Thou hast trod
Until we reach the goal in God.

My death with Thee I now believe
And all its meaning would receive.
Thy death more deeply show to me,
That from my flesh I may be free.

I long to win as Thou hast won,
To reign with Thee when Thou dost come.
If we the cross will gladly bear,
Then in Thy glory we will share.--------489
Oh, Jesus, Lord, when Thou on earth
Accompanied Thy faithful band,
It seemed they knew, but knew Thee not,
Thyself they did not understand.

They heard Thy voice, beheld Thy form,
Thy beauteous stature unforgot;
They crowded 'round Thee, met Thy gaze,
But who Thou art, they knew it not.

As they of old we too are veiled;
We've known Thee long apparently;
Yet if we say we know, at best
We know Thee not transparently.

But as the Spirit now Thou art,
Another Comforter become;
Reveal Thyself within my heart,
Since to Thy temple Thou hast come.

With Thy blest Spirit, Lord, fill me,
Fill every corner of my soul;
May Thou inspire my every part,
Oh may Thou touch, renew the whole.

The Spirit then revealing make
Thyself more real within my heart,
That ear not hear, nor eye may see
How very real to me Thou art.

When Thou in mercy dost reveal
And give Thyself as Spirit thus,
What in the world can be more real,
More true than what Thou art to us?

Thy Spirit, Lord, in mine, I pray,
O'erflow my being as a flood,
That every part with glory shine
And everywhere be Thee and God.

How close we are in such a life,
In one is blended earth with heav'n;
Thy presence sweetly fills our souls;
Our hearts are to Thy praises giv'n.--------490
Lord, when the Father ne'er was known,
The Father came through Thee below,
That we who lived in ignorance
Might through Thyself the Father know.

But, Lord, when Thou wast here on earth,
How scarce were those Thyself who knew;
A veil there was 'twixt Thee and them;
They crowded 'round but saw not through.

Now as the Spirit Thou hast come
E'en as the Father came in Thee;
As we through Thee the Father know,
Now through the Spirit we know Thee.

Not with the flesh Thou now art clothed
Then must Thou walk with toil around;
But as the Spirit in our heart
Thou dost supply Thyself unbound.

Thou, Lord, the Father once wast called,
But now the Holy Spirit art;
The Spirit is Thine other form,
Thyself to dwell within our heart.

By knowing Thee as Spirit, Lord,
We realize Thy life's outflow,
Thy glory and Thy character,
And all Thy being's wonders know.

Praise to Thy Name now floods our heart;
There is no one as dear as Thee;
For since we know how real Thou art,
No other one could lovelier be.--------491
Lord, Thou didst know when in the flesh,
As such I'd know Thee shallowly;
Then as the Spirit Thou didst come
Within my spirit, known to be.

In flesh Redeemer mine Thou art;
As Spirit now my Comforter.
The outward touch has passed away
For inward union worthier.

Because Thou art the Spirit now,
Thyself revealing ceaselessly,
Within my spirit I may know
Thy presence and reality.

I know Thy life surpassing far
The knowledge Thy disciples had,
Although they walked and lived with Thee,
When Thou on earth in flesh wast clad.

Because Thy Spirit dwells within,
How real, O Lord, Thou art to me;
Not touched, yet more reliable,
Not seen, yet loved more fervently.

Thy Holy Spirit deep within
Supplies Thyself as righteousness,
As holiness, redemption full,
As wisdom and as fruitfulness.

Thy Spirit in my spirit now
Supplies Thyself, unites with me,
Thus I am all the time myself
And constantly am also Thee.--------492
In all Thy work, O Lord, Thou didst
At Calv'ry's cross once come to rest;
Yet Thou art working still today,
But in another form expressed.

Thy saving pow'r Thou still dost show;
Thou still dost speak, enlighten, guide;
Thou and the Spirit in one stream
Sweep many in Thy living tide.

Through Him Thy power's not withheld;
Through Him Thy working does not cease;
Thou still dost comfort and command,
Encourage, strengthen, and release.

Since Thou art with the Spirit one
His coming means that Thou hast come,
And His indwelling is Thine own,
Since Thou the Spirit hast become.

He executes within my heart
All Thy desires and Thy demands,
As for the Father here on earth
Thou hast performed all His commands.

By knowing Him we know Thyself;
Obeying Him we Thee obey;
Allowing Him ourselves to fill,
We're filled with Thee, O wondrous way!

Thou art not far away in heav'n,
Leaving us here alone, apart;
But Thou art still on earth; how grand!
Thou livest right within my heart.--------493
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That gives us life and quickens us,
With all Thy riches strengthening,
O how divine and glorious!

O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That with Thy power liberates;
And by Thy liberation true
The law of life now regulates.

O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That transforms us and saturates,
And to Thine image true conforms
And with Thy light illuminates.

O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
Who in my spirit makes His home;
He mingles with my spirit too,
And both one spirit thus become.

Lord, teach me how to exercise
My spirit now to contact Thee,
That in Thy Spirit I may walk
And live by Thy reality.--------494
Christ is the testimony true
Of God in essence and in deed;
God's glory He has fully shown,
And we in Him God's nature read.

His testimony is more full
Than was the witness of the law,
Which only God in letter showed,
And not in endless living pow'r.

The fulness of the Godhead dwells
In Him, His very element;
God's full embodiment is He
A vessel, God the resident.

The Father God He manifests;
God's glorious features He displays;
In Him consummately are seen
The Father's heart and all His ways.

Christ as the Spirit now has come
That He our portion be fore'er;
In spirit we partake of Him
And all God's being fully share.--------495
Christ is God's centrality
And His universality;
He is God's delight and joy
Throughout all eternity.

He's th' embodiment of God,
In Him all God's fulness dwells;
His unique supremacy
And His Godhead none excels.

All God's purpose is for Him,
That He might be all in all;
All the things in heav'n and earth
With Himself are made withal.

All creation is for Christ,
Everything was made by Him;
'Tis by Him all things subsist,
He's the hub and He's the rim.

In redemption He is all,
All through Him is reconciled;
By His blood all things with God
Now in peace are domiciled.

He the great beginning is,
And the Church's living Head;
He her life and content too,
And the firstborn from the dead.

In God's Kingdom He's the King,
All the pow'r to Him is giv'n;
In His glory He shall rule
Over all in earth and heav'n.

In new heaven and new earth
Center of all things He'll be,
For the Godhead and for man
Throughout all eternity.

God intends in everything
Christ should have preeminence,
And that such a Christ of all
We should now experience.--------496
Christ is the one reality of all,
Of Godhead and of man and all things else;
No man without Him ever findeth God,
Without Him man and everything is false.

All types and figures of the ancient time,
All things we ever need, both great and small,
Only are shadows of the Christ of God,
Showing that He must be our all in all.

All things are vanity of vanities,
Christ, the reality all things to fill;
Though everything we may enjoy and own,
If we're devoid of Christ we're empty still.

Christ is our real God, our real Lord,
Christ is our real life, our real light;
Christ is our real food, our real drink,
Our real clothing, and our real might.

Christ also is the one reality
Of all our doctrine and theology;
And all our scriptural knowledge without Him
Is just in letter and is vanity.

Christ, the reality of time and space,
Christ, the reality of every stage;
Christ is the one reality of all
Thru all eternity from age to age.--------497
Grace in its highest definition is
God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
It is not only something done or giv'n,
But God Himself, our portion glorious.

God is incarnate in the flesh that we
Him may receive, experience ourself;
This is the grace which we receive of God,
Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.

Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,
'Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;
'Tis by this grace  the Lord experienced
That he surpassed the others in the race.

It is this grace  Christ as our inward strength
Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;
It is this grace which in our spirit is,
There energizing, working out God's will.

This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,
Is what we need and must experience;
Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,
Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.--------498
This is my wonderful story,
Christ to my heart has come;
Jesus, the King of Glory,
Finds in my heart a home.

  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, O wonderful story,
  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.

Was there e'er story so moving,
Story of love and pain;
Was there e'er Bridegroom so loving,
Seeking our hearts to gain.

  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, O wonderful story,
  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.

I am so glad I received Him,
Jesus my heart's dear King;
I who so often have grieved Him,
All to His feet would bring.

  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, O wonderful story,
  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.

How can I ever be lonely,
How can I ever fall;
What can I want, if only
Christ is my all in all?

  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, O wonderful story,
  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.

Now in His bosom confiding,
This my glad song shall be;
I am in Christ abiding,
And Christ abides in me.

  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, O wonderful story,
  Christ in me, Christ in me,
  Christ in me, the hope of glory.--------499
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!
The Christ who's all within me lives.
With Him I have been crucified;
This glorious fact to me He gives.
Now it's no longer I that live,
But Christ the Lord within me lives.

Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!
Christ now is being formed in me.
His very nature and life divine
In my whole being inwrought shall be.
All that I am came to an end,
And all of Christ is all to me.

Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!
Christ shall in me be magnified.
In nothing shall I be ashamed,
For He in all shall be applied.
In woe or blessing, death or life,
Through me shall Christ be testified.

Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!
Christ is the goal toward which I press.
Nothing I treasure, nor aught desire,
But Christ of all-inclusiveness.
My hope, my glory, and my crown
Is Christ, the One of peerlessness.--------500
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Oh, what a might! Oh, what a strength!
God wrought to raise Christ from the dead.
Far above all at His right hand,
O'er all to us He is the Head.
All this great pow'r is to the Church
That she o'er all her foes may tread.

Oh, what a fact! Oh, what a bliss!
That I of Christ a member am.
With all the saints I blend as one
And share the life of the new man.
Joined to our great ascended Head,
We'll be the Church of His own plan.

Oh, what a breadth! Oh, what a length!
The height, the depth unsearchable!
Christ the Lord is unlimited,
So vast, immense, immeas'rable.
All that He is and all He has
Is now our life unspeakable.--------501
O glorious Christ, Savior mine,
Thou art truly radiance divine;
God infinite, in eternity,
Yet man in time, finite to be.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
Thou dost manifest God's glory;
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

All things of the Father are Thine;
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,
That Thou experienced might be.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

The Spirit of life causes Thee
By Thy Word to transfer to me.
Thy Spirit touched, Thy Word received,
Thy life in me is thus conceived.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

In spirit while gazing on Thee,
As a glass reflecting Thy glory,
Like to Thyself transformed I'll be,
That Thou might be expressed thru me.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

In no other way could we be
Sanctified and share Thy vict'ry;
Thus only spiritual we'll be,
And touch the life of glory.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.

Thy Spirit will me saturate,
Every part will God permeate,
Deliv'ring me from the old man,
With all saints building for His plan.

  Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
  Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
  God mingled with humanity
  Lives in me my all to be.--------502
Once I was dead in sin,
And hope within me died;
But now I'm dead to sin,
With Christ I'm crucified.

  And can it be that "He loved me,
  And gave Himself for me"?

O height I cannot reach!
O depth I cannot sound!
O love, O boundless love,
In my Redeemer found!

  And can it be that "He loved me,
  And gave Himself for me"?

I live  and yet not I,
But Christ that lives in me,
Who from the law of sin
And death has made me free.

  And can it be that "He loved me,
  And gave Himself for me"?--------503
I serve a risen Savior;
He's in the world today.
I know that He is living,
Whatever men may say.
I see His hand of mercy;
I hear His voice of cheer;
And just the time I need Him
He's always near.

  He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
  He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
  He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
  You ask me how I know He lives?
  He lives within my heart.

In all the world around me
I see His loving care,
And though my heart grows weary,
I never will despair;
I know that He is leading,
Through all the stormy blast;
The day of His appearing
Will come at last.

  He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
  He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
  He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
  You ask me how I know He lives?
  He lives within my heart.

Rejoice, rejoice, O Christian,
Lift up your voice and sing
Eternal hallelujahs
To Jesus Christ the King!
The Hope of all who seek Him,
The Help of all who find,
None other is so loving,
So good and kind.

  He lives, He lives, Christ Jesus lives today!
  He walks with me and talks with me along life's narrow way.
  He lives, He lives, salvation to impart!
  You ask me how I know He lives?
  He lives within my heart.--------504
Jesus, I live to Thee,
The Loveliest and Best;
My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
In Thy blest love I rest.

Jesus, I die to Thee,
Whenever death shall come;
To die in Thee is life to me,
With Thee I'm ever one!

Whether to live or die,
I know not which is best;
To live in Thee is bliss to me,
To die is endless rest.

Living or dying, Lord,
I ask but to be Thine;
My life in Thee, Thy life in me,
Makes Thee forever mine.--------505
There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
He's pure and He's holy,
Triumphant and free.
He's wise and He's loving,
How tender is He!
His Life in the glory,
My life must be;
His Life in the glory,
My life must be.

There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
He overcame Satan;
From bondage He's free.
In Life He is reigning;
How kingly is He!
His Life in the glory,
My life must be;
His Life in the glory,
My life must be.

There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
In Him is no sickness;
No weakness has He.
He's strong and in vigor,
How buoyant is He!
His Life in the glory
My life may be;
His Life in the glory
My life may be.

There's a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
His peace is abiding;
How patient is He!
He's joyful and radiant,
Expecting to see
His Life in the glory
Lived out in me;
His Life in the glory
Lived out in me.--------506
Jesus lives! thy terrors now
Can, O Death, no more apall us;
Jesus lives! by this we know
Thou, O Grave, canst not enthrall us.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! henceforth is death
But the gate of Life immortal;
This shall calm our trembling breath,
When we pass its gloomy portal.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! for us He died;
Then alone to Jesus living,
Pure in heart may we abide,
Glory to our Savior giving.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! our hearts know well
Naught from us His love shall sever;
Life, nor death, nor powers of hell
Tear us from His keeping ever.
Hallelujah!

Jesus lives! to Him the Throne
Over all the world is given;
We, in spirit with Him one,
Rest and reign with Him in heaven.
Hallelujah!--------507
Once far from God and dead in sin,
No light my heart could see;
But in God's Word the light I found,
Now Christ liveth in me.

  Christ liveth in me,
  Christ liveth in me;
  Oh! what a salvation this,
  That Christ liveth in me.

As rays of light from yonder sun,
The flow'rs of earth set free,
So life and light and love come forth
From Christ living in me.

  Christ liveth in me,
  Christ liveth in me;
  Oh! what a salvation this,
  That Christ liveth in me.

As lives the flow'r within the seed,
As in the cone the tree,
So, praise the Christ of truth and grace,
His Spirit dwelleth in me.

  Christ liveth in me,
  Christ liveth in me;
  Oh! what a salvation this,
  That Christ liveth in me.

With longing all my heart is filled,
That like Him I may be,
As on the wondrous thought I dwell
That Christ liveth in me.

  Christ liveth in me,
  Christ liveth in me;
  Oh! what a salvation this,
  That Christ liveth in me.--------508
Made free! Made free! O captive!
Bound by the law of sin,
The law of life in Spirit
Will quicken you within.
And counting on the Spirit,
His life shall now control
The members of your body,
The portals of your soul.

Made free! Made free in Jesus:
For crucified with Him,
From center to circumf'rence,
He breaks the power of sin.
No longer act in body
As if it had no "law";
His "law of life" must govern
All that ran wild before.

Made free! Made free in Jesus:
Deep planted in His death,
He liberates His life pow'r,
And breathes His Spirit's breath.
Then waxing strong in spirit,
With force of quickening life;
The soul and body governed,
Its members cease from strife!

Made free! Made free in Jesus:
Joined to the Risen One,
By conflict prayer you triumph,
And claim His victory won.
Freed with His glorious freedom,
Above the darkness rife;
For now the law of sin and death
Is conquered by His life.--------509
A flowing river and a tree,
Eden's outstanding features are,
Man to supply with food and drink
That he may live fore'er.

  God is in Christ to be my supply,
  God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
  If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
  Filled with His life I'll be.

The tree the glorious Christ does show,
As living food to man supplied,
That he God's riches may enjoy,
Thus to be satisfied.

  God is in Christ to be my supply,
  God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
  If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
  Filled with His life I'll be.

The river does the Spirit show,
Coming man's spirit to supply,
That with God's riches he be filled,
Holy to be thereby.

  God is in Christ to be my supply,
  God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
  If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
  Filled with His life I'll be.

The Christ of glory is my life,
He as the Spirit lives in mine,
That I with God be fully blent
And in His image shine.

  God is in Christ to be my supply,
  God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
  If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
  Filled with His life I'll be.

I would exalt this glorious Christ,
Ever the Spirit I'd obey,
Making His glory fully known,
Filled with His grace for aye.

  God is in Christ to be my supply,
  God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
  If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
  Filled with His life I'll be.--------510
I've found the One of peerless worth,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And sing I must, for Christ I have:
Oh, what a Christ have I!

My Christ, He is the Lamb of God,
Who full salvation brings;
He is the Sun of Righteousness,
With healing in His wings.

My Christ, He is the Tree of Life
With fruit abundant, sweet;
My hunger He doth satisfy;
Of Him I daily eat.

My Christ, He is the smitten Rock
Whence living waters burst;
He is the fountain in my heart
Which quenches all my thirst.

Christ is my life, my light my way,
My comfort and my health,
My peace, my rest, my joy, my hope,
My glory and my wealth.

Christ is my wisdom and my pow'r,
My boast and righteousness,
My vict'ry and redemption sure,
My truth and holiness.

Christ is my Savior, Shepherd, Lord,
My Advocate above,
My Counsellor, my Father, God,
My Brother, Friend, and Love.

Christ is my Captain and my Guard,
My Teacher and my Guide,
My Bridegroom, Master and my Head;
In me doth He reside.

Christ is my Prophet, Priest, and King;
My Prophet full of sight;
My Priest that stands 'twixt me and God,
My King that rules with might.

10 Christ is the Author of my faith,
And its Perfecter too,
My Mediator, Guarantee,
And faithful Witness true.

11 Christ is my everlasting home,
My all-sufficient land;
My fortress, tower, hiding-place,
And my eternal stand.

12 Christ is my sabbath and new moon,
My morning and my day,
My age and my eternity
That ne'er will pass away.

13 Christ is my trust and my desire,
In comeliness replete,
My satisfaction and delight,
Who all my need doth meet.

14 My Christ, the all-inclusive One,
My Christ what shall I call?
He is the first, He is the last,
My Christ is All in all.

15 Since such a treasure I possess,
My heart doth sing for joy;
And I must sing, and sing again;
Oh, what a Christ have I!--------511

Jesus, Sun and Shield art Thou,
Sun and Shield forever.
Never canst Thou cease to shine,
Cease to guard us, never.
Cheer our steps as on we go,
Come between us and the foe.

Jesus, Bread and Wine art Thou,
Wine and Bread forever.
Never canst Thou cease to feed
Or refresh us, never.
Feed us still on bread divine,
Drink we still of heavenly wine.

Life and Love forever.
Ne'er to quicken shalt Thou cease,
Or to love us, never.
All of life and love we need

Once it was the blessing,
Now it is the Lord;
Once it was the feeling,
Now it is His Word;
Once His gift I wanted,
Now, the Giver own;
Once I sought for healing,
Now Himself alone.

  All in all forever,
  Only Christ I'll sing;
  Everything is in Christ,
  And Christ is everything.

Once 'twas painful trying,
Now 'tis perfect trust;
Once a half salvation,
Now the uttermost;
Once 'twas ceaseless holding,
Now He holds me fast;
Once 'twas constant drifting,
Now my anchor's cast.

  All in all forever,
  Only Christ I'll sing;
  Everything is in Christ,
  And Christ is everything.

Once 'twas busy planning,
Now 'tis trustful prayer;
Once 'twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once 'twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once 'twas constant asking,
Now 'tis ceaseless praise.

  All in all forever,
  Only Christ I'll sing;
  Everything is in Christ,
  And Christ is everything.

Once it was my working,
His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him,
Now He uses me;
Once the pow'r I wanted,
Now the Mighty One;
Once for self I labored,
Now for Him alone.

  All in all forever,
  Only Christ I'll sing;
  Everything is in Christ,
  And Christ is everything.

Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He's mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.

  All in all forever,
  Only Christ I'll sing;
  Everything is in Christ,
  And Christ is everything.--------514
There is One amid all changes
Who standeth ever fast,
One who covers all the future,
The present and the past;
It is Christ the Rock of Ages,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

  Jesus is the first,
  Jesus is the last,
  Trust Him for thy future,
  Leave with Him the past;
  Jesus is the first,
  Jesus is the last,
  Christ the Rock of Ages,
  The first and the last.

There is One whose arms upholdeth
This whole creation vast,
Yet He bids us on His bosom
Our cares and sorrows cast;
Let us bring them all to Jesus,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

  Jesus is the first,
  Jesus is the last,
  Trust Him for thy future,
  Leave with Him the past;
  Jesus is the first,
  Jesus is the last,
  Christ the Rock of Ages,
  The first and the last.

There is One whose love has kept us
Through every stormy blast,
And His hand will guard and guide us
Till all the storms are past;
Jesus, we will trust Thee ever,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

The first and the last,
The first and the last.

  Jesus is the first,
  Jesus is the last,
  Trust Him for thy future,

All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Jesus Christ is life's perfection,
Perfect love and perfect light.
Son of God, the true reflection
Of the Father's radiance bright.
All the treasures of God's riches,
All the secrets of His wisdom,
All in Christ are hid away.
Let His name be praised today!

All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Blessings are imparted to us
By the shameful cross He bore.
By His suffering inglorious
We have peace forevermore.
By the Cross we have forgiveness,
Life eternal, endless mercy.
By God's Son is freely giv'n
Everything in earth and heav'n.

All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
In me there is naught but weakness,
I am worthless, full of sin,
Stricken by its mortal sickness,
Lacking light and hope within.
Now in Christ I find abundant
Victory and strength and power.
Savior, come and live in me,
Come and make me rich in Thee.

All is in Christ;
God's dear Son is Lord of all.
Savior, pardon my transgressions,
For my love is still so small;
Though I gave all my possessions,
This would profit scarce at all.
'Tis myself that Thou desirest;
So I give myself, dear Master;
No thing hast Thou kept from me
Nor will I keep aught from Thee.

All is in Christ;
Your whole self present to Him.
Vain your quest for lasting pleasure,
Wealth, success, and worldly fame;
Christ alone must be your treasure,
His resource your only claim.
Come, let Him disperse the famine
Of your arid, waste existence.
Let God's Son, th' Immortal King
Freely give you everything.--------516
Lord of all being, throned afar,
Thy glory flames from sun and star;
Center and light of every sphere,
Yet to each loving heart how near.

Sun of our life, Thy quickening ray
Sheds on our path the glow of day;
Star of our hope, Thy softened light
Cheers the long watches of the night.

Our midnight is Thy smile withdrawn,
Our noontide is Thy gracious dawn,
Our rainbow arch Thy mercy's sign;
All, save the clouds of sin, are Thine.

Lord of all life, below, above,
Whose light is truth, whose warmth is love,
Before Thy ever-blazing throne
We ask no luster of our own.

Grant us Thy truth to make us free,
And kindling hearts that burn for Thee,
Till all Thy living altars claim
One holy light, one heavenly flame.--------517
Jesus, my Savior, is all things to me;
Oh, what a wonderful Savior is He,
Guiding, protecting, o'er life's rolling sea,
Mighty Deliv'rer  Jesus for me.

  Jesus for me,
  Jesus for me,
  All the time everywhere,
  Jesus for me.

Jesus in sickness, and Jesus in health,
Jesus in poverty, comfort or wealth;
Sunshine or tempest, whatever it be,
He is my safety  Jesus for me.

  Jesus for me,
  Jesus for me,
  All the time everywhere,
  Jesus for me.

He is my Refuge, my Rock, and my Tower,
He is my Fortress, my Strength and my Pow'r;
Life everlasting, my Daysman is He,
Blessed Redeemer  Jesus for me.

  Jesus for me,
  Jesus for me,
  All the time everywhere,
  Jesus for me.

He is my Prophet, my Priest and my King,
He is my Bread of Life, Fountain and Spring;
Bright Sun of Righteousness, Daystar is He,
Horn of Salvation  Jesus for me.

  Jesus for me,
  Jesus for me,
  All the time everywhere,
  Jesus for me.

Jesus in sorrow, in joy, or in pain,
Jesus my Treasure in loss or in gain;
Constant Companion where'er I may be,
Living or dying  Jesus for me.

  Jesus for me,
  Jesus for me,
  All the time everywhere,
  Jesus for me.--------518
Whom have I, Lord, in heav'n but Thee?
None but Thee! None but Thee!
And this my song through life shall be:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
He hath for me the serpent trod,
He hath redeemed me "by His blood,"
And reconciled my soul to God:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

I envy not the rich their joys:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
I covet not earth's glitt'ring toys:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Earth can no lasting bliss bestow,
"Fading" is stamped on all below;
Mine is a joy no end can know:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

Though with the poor be cast my lot:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
"He knoweth best," I murmur not:
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Though "vine" and "fig-tree" blight assail,
The "labor of the olive fail,"
And death o'er flock and herd prevail,
Christ for me! Christ for me!

Though I am now on hostile ground,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
And sin beset me all around,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Let earth her fiercest battles wage,
And foes against my soul engage,
Strong in His strength I scorn their rage:
Christ for me! Christ for me!

And when my life draws to its close,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
Safe in His arms I shall repose,
Christ for me! Christ for me!
When sharpest pains my frame pervade,
And all the powers of nature fade,
Still will I sing through death's cold shade;
Christ for me! Christ for me!--------519
My heart is fixed, eternal God,
Fixed on Thee, fixed on Thee;
And my immortal choice is made,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
He is my prophet, priest, and king,
Who did for me salvation bring,
And while I've breath I mean to sing,
Christ for me, Christ for me.

In Him I see the Godhead shine,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
He is the majesty divine,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
The Father's well-beloved Son,
Co-partner of His royal throne,
Who bore the guilt of man alone,
Christ for me, Christ for me.

Let others boast of heaps of gold,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
His riches never can be told,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
Your gold will waste and wear away,
Your honors perish in a day;
My portion never can decay,
Christ for me, Christ for me.

In pining sickness, or in health,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
In deepest poverty or wealth,
Christ for me, Christ for me;
And in that all-important day,
When I the summons must obey,
And pass from this dark world away,
Christ for me, Christ for me.--------520
None other Lamb, none other Name,
None other hope in heav'n or earth or sea,
None other hiding-place from guilt and shame,
None beside Thee.

My faith burns low, my hope burns low;
Only my heart's desire cries out in me
By the deep thunder of its want and woe,
Cries out to Thee.

Lord, Thou art Life, though I be dead;
Love's fire Thou art, however cold I be;
Nor heaven have I, nor place to lay my head,
Nor home but Thee.--------521
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,
And I begin to see,
What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
What they may be to Thee;
If only they will yield Thee all,
And trustingly obey Thy call.

How wonderful! I never knew
That I might trust Thee so;
That Thou wouldst be so much to me,
In all the way I go,
That every need Thou wouldst supply,
And all my longings satisfy.

I take Thee as my keeper now,
And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause,
In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.

I take Thee for my peace, O Lord,
My heart to keep and fill,
Thine own great calm, amid earth's storms
Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep'ning peace.

I take Thee as my wisdom too,
For wisdom's sum Thou art;
Thou, who dost choose the foolish things,
Set me henceforth apart,
That I may speak and work for Thee
As Thou shalt work and speak in me.

I take Thee, Lord, to be my all,
Since all Thou art is mine;
I nothing have, and nothing am;
That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
Thou shalt be everything to me,
In all things my sufficiency.--------522
O Christ, in Thee my soul hath found,
And found in Thee alone,
The peace, the joy I sought so long,
The bliss till now unknown.

  Now none but Christ can satisfy,
  None other name for me;
  There's love and life and lasting joy,
  Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

I sighed for rest and happiness,
I yearned for them, not Thee;
But, while I passed my Savior by,
His love laid hold on me.

  Now none but Christ can satisfy,
  None other name for me;
  There's love and life and lasting joy,
  Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

I tried the broken cisterns, Lord,
But, ah, the waters failed!
E'en as I stooped to drink they fled,
And mocked me as I wailed.

  Now none but Christ can satisfy,
  None other name for me;
  There's love and life and lasting joy,
  Lord Jesus, found in Thee.

The pleasures lost I sadly mourned,
But never wept for Thee,
Till grace the sightless eyes received,
Thy loveliness to see.

  Now none but Christ can satisfy,
  None other name for me;
  There's love and life and lasting joy,
  Lord Jesus, found in Thee.--------523
I have come to the Fountain of Life,
A fountain that flows from above;
I have passed from the waters of strife
And come to the Elim of love;
I have drunk of the heavenly well,
In the depths of my being it springs.
No mortal can measure or tell
The gladness the Comforter brings.

  Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
  The fountain that never runs dry;
  Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
  For Christ is the Fountain of Life.

I have come to the Fountain of Blood
That for guilt and uncleanness doth flow;
I have washed in its sin-cleansing flood
And my garments are whiter than snow.
I count not my righteousness mine
'Tis Jesus that lives in my soul.
I partake of His nature divine,
And in Him I am perfectly whole.

  Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
  The fountain that never runs dry;
  Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
  For Christ is the Fountain of Life.

I have come to the Fountain of Health,
A boundless and endless supply;
'Tis a secret man's wisdom or wealth
Can never discover or buy.
But the secret my Lord hath revealed
In the fountain that flows from His side,
In the stripes by whose pain we are healed,
In Himself as He comes to abide.

  Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
  The fountain that never runs dry;
  Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
  For Christ is the Fountain of Life.

I have come to the Fountain of Joy;
His joy is the strength of my heart.
My delight is unmixed with alloy,
My sunshine can never depart.
The fig tree may wither and die,
Earth's pleasures and prospects decline;
But my fountains can never be dry
My portion, my joy is divine.

  Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
  The fountain that never runs dry;
  Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
  For Christ is the Fountain of Life.--------524
I have found, I have found the way
Which leads to heav'nly rest;
I have found, I have found the peace
Which filled my Savior's breast.
O friends in the desert past,
Come, join in prayer and praise;
E'en now He waits our cry,
The Savior who saves always.

He hath taken our sins away,
When on Calv'ry's cross He bled;
The disease of our soul He heals
By His Spirit freely shed;
Though Satan hath pierced us deep,
And great the grace each prays;
The more we prove His might,
The Savior who saves always.

Long, alas! in the gloom I fought,
'Mid strife of wind and waves;
Jesus seemed only this to me:
A Savior who sometimes saves.
But sweet are the light and calm
That fill my happy days,
Since now I fully trust
The Savior who saves always.

O my Sun and my Shield art Thou!
Lead on where Thou hast trod;
My Salvation, my Joy, my Song,
My Brother, and yet my God.
Whate'er then my life betide,
I now can trust and praise;
Each moment Thou wilt save,
O Savior, who sav'st always.--------525
Jesus, Fountain of my days,
Well-spring of my heart's delight,
Brightness of my morning rays,
Solace of my hours of night;
When I see Thee, I arise
To the hope of cloudless skies.

Oh, how weary were the years
Ere Thy form to me was known;
Oh, how gloomy were the fears
When I seemed to be alone;
I despaired the storm to brave
Till Thy footprints touched the wave.

But Thy presence on the deep
Calmed the pulses of the sea,
And the waters sank to sleep
In the rest of seeing Thee;
And my once rebellious will
Heard the mandate, Peace, be still!

Now Thy will and mine are one,
Heart in heart, and hand in hand;
All the clouds have touched the sun,
And the ships have reached the land;
For Thy love has said to me,
No more night! and No more sea!--------526
Lord, Thou hast made Thyself to me
A living, bright reality,
More present to faith's vision keen
Than any earthly object seen;
More dear, more intimately nigh
Than e'en the closest earthly tie.

And Thou, blest vision of my soul,
Hast made my broken nature whole;
Hast purified my base desires,
And kindled passion's holiest fires;
My nature Thou hast lifted up,
And filled me with a glorious hope.

Nearer and dearer still to me,
Thou living, loving Savior be;
Brighter the vision of Thy face,
More charming still Thy words of grace;
So, life shall be transformed to love,
Thy grace and mercy more to prove.--------527
The Lord's my Shepherd, I'll not want;
He make me down to lie
In pastures green; He leadeth me
The quiet waters by.

My soul He doth restore again,
And me to walk doth make
Within the paths of righteousness,
E'en for His own name's sake.

Yea, though I walk in death's dark vale,
Yet will I fear no ill;
For Thou art with me, and Thy rod
And staff me comfort still.

My table Thou hast furnishd
In presence of my foes;
My head Thou dost with oil anoint,
And my cup overflows.

Goodness and mercy all my life
Shall surely follow me,
And in God's house forevermore
My dwelling-place shall be.--------528
The King of love my Shepherd is,
Whose goodness faileth never;
I nothing lack if I am His,
And He is mine forever.

Where streams of living water flow
My ransomed soul He leadeth,
And, where the verdant pastures grow,
With food celestial feedeth.

Perverse and foolish oft I strayed,
But yet in love He sought me,
And on His shoulder gently laid,
And home rejoicing brought me.

In death's dark vale I fear no ill
With Thee, dear Lord, beside me;
Thy rod and staff my comfort still,
Thy Cross before to guide me.

Thou spread'st a table in my sight;
Thy unction grace bestoweth;
And oh, what transport of delight
From Thy pure chalice floweth!

And so through all the length of days
Thy goodness faileth never;
Good Shepherd, may I sing Thy praise
Within Thy house forever.--------529
How tedious and tasteless the hours
When Jesus no longer I see!
Sweet prospects, sweet birds and sweet flow'rs,
Have all lost their sweetness to me.
The midsummer sun shines but dim,
The fields strive in vain to look gay;
But when I am happy in Him
December's as pleasant as May.

His name yields the richest perfume,
And sweeter than music His voice;
His presence disperses my gloom,
And makes all within me rejoice.
I should, were He always thus nigh,
Have nothing to wish or to fear;
No mortal so happy as I;
My summer would last all the year.

Content with beholding His face,
My all to His pleasure resigned;
No changes of season or place,
Would make any change in my mind.
While blessed with a sense of His love,
A palace a toy would appear;
And prisons would palaces prove,
If Jesus would dwell with me there.

My Lord, if indeed I am Thine,
If Thou art my sun and my song,
Say, why do I languish and pine?
And why are my winters so long?
Oh, drive these dark clouds from the sky,
Thy soul-cheering presence restore;
Or take me to Thee up on high,
Where winter and clouds are no more.--------530
Jesus is all the world to me:
My life, my joy, my all.
He is my strength from day to day;
Without Him I would fall.
When I am sad, to Him I go;
No other one can cheer me so.
When I am sad, He makes me glad;
He's my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
My Friend in trials sore.
I go to Him for blessings, and
He gives them o'er and o'er.
He sends the sunshine and the rain;
He sends the harvest's golden grain:
Sunshine and rain, harvest of grain
He's my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
And true to Him I'll be.
Oh, how could I this Friend deny
When He's so true to me?
Following Him I know I'm right;
He watches o'er me day and night.
Following Him by day and night,
He's my Friend.

Jesus is all the world to me,
I want no better friend.
I trust Him now; I'll trust Him when
Life's fleeting days shall end.
Beautiful life with such a Friend;
Beautiful life that has no end!
Eternal life, eternal joy,
He's my Friend.--------531
Fade, fade each earthly joy;
Jesus is mine.
Break every tender tie;
Jesus is mine.
Dark is the wilderness,
Earth has no resting place,
Jesus alone can bless;
Jesus is mine.

Tempt not my soul away;
Jesus is mine.
Here would I ever stay;
Jesus is mine.
Perishing things of clay,
Born but for one brief day,
Pass from my heart away;
Jesus is mine.

Farewell, ye dreams of night;
Jesus is mine.
Lost in this dawning bright;
Jesus is mine.
All that my soul has tried
Left but a dismal void;
Jesus has satisfied;
Jesus is mine.

Farewell, mortality;
Jesus is mine.
Welcome, eternity;
Jesus is mine.
Welcome, O Loved and Blest,
Welcome, sweet scenes of rest,
Welcome, my Savior's breast;
Jesus is mine.--------532
Thou hidden source of calm repose,
Thou all-sufficient love divine;
My help and refuge from my foes,
Secure I am, if Thou art mine;
From sin and grief, from guilt and shame,
I hide me, Jesus, in Thy name.

Jesus, my All in all Thou art,
My rest in toil, mine ease in pain;
The med'cine of my broken heart;
In war, my peace; in loss, my gain;
My smile beneath the tyrant's frown;
In shame, my glory and my crown.

In want, my plentiful supply;
In weakness, mine almighty power;
In bonds, my perfect liberty;
My light in Satan's darkest hour;
In grief, my joy unspeakable;
My life in death; my Lord, my all.--------533
For every sin however deep,
For every path however steep,
For all the weary ones who weep,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.

For every trial great or small,
For every care that would appall,
For all the stumbling feet that fall,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.

When earthly things bring sweet delight,
When all is well, and skies are bright,
When ease would cloud the heavenly light,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.

When sorrow darkens all the day,
When disappointments bar the way,
When hearts are numb and cannot pray,
Thou art sufficient, Lord.

Whate'er my circumstances be,
Help me in all Thy hand to see,
So wilt Thou then be unto me,
My all-sufficient Lord.--------534

All things are possible to him
That can in Jesus' name believe;
Lord, I no more Thy name blaspheme,
Thy truth I lovingly receive.
I can, I do believe in Thee;
All things are possible to me.

'Twas most impossible of all
That here sin's reign in me should cease;
Yet shall it be, I know it shall;
Jesus, I trust Thy faithfulness.
If nothing is too hard for Thee,
All things are possible to me.

Though earth and hell the Word gainsay,
The Word of God shall never fail;
The Lord can break sin's iron sway;
'Tis certain, though impossible.
The thing impossible shall be,
All things are possible to me.

All things are possible to God;
To Christ, the power of God in man;
To me when I am all renewed,
In Christ am fully formed again,
And from the reign of sin set free,
All things are possible to me.

All things are possible to God;
To Christ, the power of God in me;
Now shed Thy mighty Self abroad,
Let me no longer live, but Thee;
Give me this hour in Thee to prove
The sweet omnipotence of love.--------536
Objective and subjective Christ is to us,
In heaven He's pleading objectively thus;
Subjectively now in His members He lives
And inwardly to them His being He gives.

In heaven He sits at the right hand of God,
Where as the High Priest He presented His blood;
Our Advocate, bearing our burdens above,
Our Surety, He careth for us in His love.

He now is the Spirit, our spirit within;
He's there as our life, all things bringing with Him;
He's there as our strength and our grace every hour,
Our Paraclete in us, sustaining with pow'r.

In heaven for us He's the glorified man,
The Forerunner entered, fulfilling God's plan;
Man into God bringing and making him one
With God in the heav'nlies, in Him as the Son.

In us all the fulness of God dwells in Him;
As Spirit He brings God Himself thus within,
Revealing and making God real unto us,
God one with us building in life glorious.

The Savior ascended in heaven now dwells,
And soon He's returning for us His Word tells;
Deliverer indwelling, He now in us lives,
And soon will transfigure, His glory to give.

The day soon is coming when heaven and earth
Will mingle in one in that city of worth;
Objective and subjective will in that day
Be mingled within us in glory for aye.--------537

Chorus line 3: 'admire' changed to 'enjoy'

O Lord, Thou art in me as life
And everything to me!
Subjective and available,
Thus I experience Thee.

  O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!
  How dear and near to me!
  How I enjoy Thy marvelous
  Availability!

To all my needs both great and small
Thou art the rich supply;
So ready and sufficient too
For me now to apply.

In weakness doth sustain;

Thy law of life in heart and mind
My conduct regulates;

Unrivaled unity!

What release the Savior gave me!
Christ indeed has set me free!
All the pow'r of sin is broken,
All death's sting is passed from me!

  Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
  By His mighty victory,
  Now His resurrection power
  From my spirit strengthens me!

From the law Christ has delivered,
To its claims I'm ever dead;
Nevermore the law shall bind me,
But by grace I'll live instead.

  Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
  By His mighty victory,
  Now His resurrection power
  From my spirit strengthens me!

Christ has sin condemned at Calv'ry
And its power done away;
Now it has no ground within me,
I am freed from all its sway.

  Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
  By His mighty victory,
  Now His resurrection power
  From my spirit strengthens me!

Death by Him has been abolished,
Incorrupted life is shown;
Death's enthralling bonds are broken,
Resurrection life is known.

  From my spirit strengthens me!

World and demons by His might,
From the pow'r of darkness brought me
To the realm of life and light.

  From my spirit strengthens me!

All-sufficient grace He giveth,
With His pow'r He covers me,
Makes me glory in my weakness
And in weakness strengthens me.

  Christ has made me more than conqu'ror,
  By His mighty victory,
  Now His resurrection power
  From my spirit strengthens me!--------541
Not the law of letters,
But the Christ of life
God desires to give us,
Saving us from strife;
It is not some doctrine,
But 'tis Christ Himself
Who alone releases
From our sinful self.

Any kind of teaching,
Any kind of form,
Cannot quicken spirits
Or our souls transform;
It is Christ as Spirit
Gives us life divine,
Thus thru us to live the
Life of God's design.

Not philosophy nor
Any element
Can to Christ conform us
As His complement;
But 'tis Christ Himself who
All our nature takes
And in resurrection
Us His members makes.

Not religion, even
Christianity,
Can fulfill God's purpose
Or economy;
But 'tis Christ within us
As our all in all
Satisfies God's wishes,
And His plan withal.

All the gifts we're given
By the Lord in grace,
All the different functions
Cannot Christ replace.
Only Christ Himself must
Be our all in all!
Only Christ Himself in
All things, great or small!--------542
O the riches of my Savior,
So unsearchable, immense;
All the fulness of the Godhead
I may now experience.

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!

O the riches of my Savior,
All-embracing: life and light,
Wisdom, power, healing, comfort,
Treasures rich of God's delight;

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!

God's redemption, full salvation,
And His resurrection pow'r,
Sanctifying, glorifying,
All transcending every hour!

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!

O the riches of my Savior
Nothing less than God as all!
All His person and possessions,
Now my spirit doth enthrall.

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!

O the riches of my Savior!
Who can know their breadth and length,
Or their depth and height unmeasured,
Yet they are my joy and strength.

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!

May I know these boundless riches,
Christ experience in full;
And with others may I share them
In their content bountiful.

  O the riches, O the riches,
  Christ my Savior has for me!
  How unsearchable their measure,
  Yet my full reality!--------543
I give my heart to Thee,
O Jesus most desired;
And heart for heart the gift shall be,
For Thou my heart hast fired.

Thou hearts alone wouldst move,
Thou only hearts dost love;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.

What off'ring can I make,
Dear Lord, to love like Thine;
That Thou, the Word, didst stoop to take
A human form like mine?

"Give Me thy heart, my son":
Lord, Thou my heart hast won;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.

Thy heart is opened wide,
Its offered love most free,
That heart to heart I may abide,
And hide myself in Thee.

Ah, how Thy love doth burn,
Till I that love return!
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.

Here finds my heart its rest,
Repose that knows no shock,
The strength of love that keeps it blest
In Thee, the riven Rock.

My heart, as girt around,
Her citadel hath found;
I would love Thee as Thou lov'st me,
O Jesus most desired.--------544
Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou,
If ever I love Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.

I love Thee, because Thou hast first lovd me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary's tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.

I'll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.

In ages eternal of endless delight
I'll ever adore Thee in glory so bright;
I'll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, 'tis now.--------545
When this passing world is done,
When has sunk yon glaring sun,
When we stand with Christ on high,
Looking o'er life's history;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
Not till then, how much I owe.

When I stand before the throne
Dressed in beauty not my own,
When I see Thee as Thou art,
Love Thee with unsinning heart;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
Not till then, how much I owe.

E'en on earth, as through a glass
Darkly, let Thy glory pass;
Make forgiveness feel so sweet;
Make Thy Spirit's help so meet:
E'en on earth, Lord, make me know
Something of how much I owe.--------546
I love my Lord, but with no love of mine,
For I have none to give;
I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine,
For by Thy love I live.
I am as nothing, and rejoice to be
Emptied, and lost, and swallowed up in Thee.

Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need,
And there is none beside;
From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed,
In Thee the bless'd abide.
Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace,
Our source, our center, and our dwelling-place.--------547
Something every heart is loving:
If not Jesus, none can rest;
Lord, my heart to Thee is given;
Take it, for it loves Thee best.

Thus I cast the world behind me;
Jesus most beloved shall be;
Beauteous more than all things beauteous,
He alone is joy to me.

Bright with all eternal radiance
Is the glory of Thy face;
Thou art loving, sweet, and tender,
Full of pity, full of grace.

When I hated, Thou didst love me,
Shedd'st for me Thy precious blood;
Still Thou lovest, lovest ever,
Shall I not love Thee, my God?

Keep my heart still faithful to Thee,
That my earthly life may be
But a shadow to that glory
Of my hidden life in Thee.--------548
Earthen vessel I was made,
Christ in me the treasure laid;
His container I must be,
As the content He in me.

In His image I was made,
Fit that Christ should all pervade;
Thus the vessel God did form
With the content uniform.

In my spirit He remains,
With His power He sustains;
As the Spirit one with me,
He is my reality.

Moving in me day by day,
Mingling with me all the way,
All my steps He regulates,
Every part He saturates.

Him expressing from within,
Making Him to others seen,
I transparent have to be
That He may be shown thru me.

Transformation is my need,
To be broken more indeed,
That the clay may change in form,
To the treasure to conform.--------549
Enter the veil and go without the camp,
Taste heaven's sweetness, thus the earth forsake;
If by the Holiest I am satisfied,
How can I of earth's vanities partake?

Enter the veil and go without the camp,
By heaven's presence will the earth depart;
If heaven's glory doth my spirit charm,
How can earth's happiness possess my heart?

Enter the veil, behold the glorious Christ,
Go out the camp to Jesus, let Him lead;
If throne and crown my spirit here enthrall,
Manger and cross cannot my steps impede.

Enter the veil for resurrection pow'r,
Go out the camp to bear the cross and woe,
If I His radiant face in heaven see,
His footsteps I will follow here below.

Enter the veil, on heaven's fatness feast,
Without the camp, in hardship persevere;
Though earthly trials sorely pain my heart,
Heaven's communion doth my spirit cheer.

Enter the veil, Christ's riches there enjoy,
Without the camp, the needs of men supply;
The life of heaven living out thru me
The souls of earth will bless and satisfy.

Enter the veil till it exists no more,
Go out the camp till all the camps are gone;
Until the heavens and the earth unite,
Till God and man together dwell in one.--------550
Through Thy precious body broken
Inside the veil;
Oh! what words to sinners spoken
Inside the veil.
Precious as the blood that brought us;
Perfect, as the love that sought us;
Holy, as the Lamb that brought us
Inside the veil.

When we see Thy love unshaken
Outside the camp.
Scorned by man, by God forsaken
Outside the camp.
Thy loved cross alone can charm us;
Shame need now no more alarm us;
Glad we follow, nought can harm us
Outside the camp.

Lamb of God, through Thee we enter
Inside the veil.
Cleansed by Thee, we boldly venture
Inside the veil.
Not a stain; a new creation:
Ours is such a full salvation;
Low we bow in adoration
Inside the veil.

Unto Thee, the homeless stranger
Outside the camp,
Forth we hasten, fear no danger
Outside the camp.
Thy reproach, far richer treasure
Than all Egypt's boasted pleasure;
Drawn by love that knows no measure
Outside the camp.

Soon Thy saints shall all be gathered
Inside the veil.
All with Thee  no more be scattered
Inside the veil.
Nought from Thee, our hearts shall sever;
We shall see Thee; grieve Thee never;
"Praise the Lamb!" shall sound forever
Inside the veil.--------551
I've believed the true report,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the outer court,
O glory be to God!
I am all on Jesus' side,
On the altar sanctified,
To the world and sin I've died,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I have passed the riven veil,
  Here the glories never fail,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I am living in the presence of the King.

I'm a king and priest to God,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
By the cleansing of the blood,
O glory be to God!
By the Spirit's pow'r and light,
I am living day and night,
In the holiest place so bright,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I have passed the riven veil,
  Here the glories never fail,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I am living in the presence of the King.

I have passed the outer veil,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Which did once God's light conceal,
O glory be to God!
But the blood has brought me in
To God's holiness so clean,
Where there's death to self and sin,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I have passed the riven veil,
  Here the glories never fail,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I am living in the presence of the King.

I'm within the holiest pale,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!
I have passed the inner veil,
O glory be to God!
I am sanctified to God
By the power of the blood,
Now the Lord is my abode,
Hallelujah to the Lamb!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I have passed the riven veil,
  Here the glories never fail,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  I am living in the presence of the King.--------552
Marvel not that Christ in glory
All my inmost heart hath won;
Not a star to cheer my darkness,
But a light beyond the sun,
All below lies dark and shadowed,
Nothing here to claim my heart,
Save the lonely track of sorrow
Where of old He walked apart.

Others in the earthly sunshine
Wearily may journey on,
I have seen a light from heaven
Past the brightness of the sun
Light that knows no cloud, no waning,
Light wherein I see His face,
All His love's uncounted treasures,
All the riches of His grace:

All the wonders of His glory,
Deeper wonders of His love
How for me He won, He keepeth
That high standing all above;
Not a glimpse  the veil uplifted
But within the veil to dwell,
Gazing on His face forever,
Hearing words unspeakable.

I have seen the face of Jesus
Tell me not of aught beside;
I have heard the voice of Jesus
All my soul is satisfied.
In the radiance of the glory
First I saw His blessed face,
And forever shall that glory
Be my home, my dwelling-place.--------553
  Repeat the last line of each verse

In the secret of His presence
How my soul delights to hide!
Oh, how precious are the lessons
Which I learn at Jesus' side!
Earthly cares can never vex me,
Neither trials lay me low;
For when Satan comes to tempt me,
To the secret place I go.

When my soul is faint and thirsty,
'Neath the shadow of His wing
There is cool and pleasant shelter,
And a fresh and crystal spring;
And my Savior rests beside me,
As we hold communion sweet;
If I tried, I could not utter
What He says when thus we meet.

Only this I know: I tell Him
All my doubts and griefs and fears;
Oh, how patiently He listens!
And my drooping soul He cheers;
Do you think He ne'er reproves me?
What a false friend He would be,
If He never, never told me
Of the sins which He must see.

Would you like to know that sweetness
Of the secret of the Lord?
Go and hide beneath the shadow;
This shall then be your reward;
And whene'er you leave the silence
Of that happy meeting-place,
By the Spirit bear the image
Of the Master in your face.--------554
I come to His presence afresh
Ere the night has passed into morning;
And His face I see as it shines on me
The Lord within is dawning.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And with sweet delight I partake of Him,
My hunger has passed away.

As Spirit He speaks thru the Word
Till my heart in echo is singing,
And the fount of life with His grace and pow'r
Within my soul is springing.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And I drink of Him for my every need,
My thirsting has passed away.

In tenderness He deals with me,
While I stay with joy in His presence;
And He saturates and supplies my soul
With all His precious essence.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And in every way I partake of Him,
My problems all passed away.--------555
Still, still with Thee, when purple morning breaketh,
When the bird waketh, and the shadows flee;
Fairer than morning, lovelier than daylight,
Dawns the sweet consciousness, I am with Thee.

As in the dawning, o'er the waveless ocean,
The image of the morning star doth rest,
So in this stillness Thou beholdest only
Thine image in the waters of my breast.

When sinks the soul, subdued by toil, to slumber,
Its closing eye looks up to Thee in prayer;
Sweet the repose, beneath Thy wings o'ershadowing,
But sweeter still to wake and find Thee there.

So shall it be at last, in that bright morning
When the soul waketh, and life's shadows flee;
Oh, in that hour, fairer than daylight's dawning,
Shall rise the glorious thought, I am with Thee!--------556
*henna: an Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Songs 1:!4)

Thy name is sweet as ointment pourd forth;
Better Thy love than wine, O draw Thou me!
If we the footsteps follow of the flock,
Entered Thy fellowship of love we'll be.

He's my Beloved, I am His own love;
He draweth me, pursue I after Him.
Fragrant as myrrh, I'd hide Him in my heart;
Beauteous as henna*, I'd be clothed with Him;

Bathe in His love, and of His fatness taste,
Lie on His breast, His sweetness there enjoy;
His love the banner, His affection shown
Tenderly soothes my heart to purest joy.

Oh, my Beloved's mine, and I am His;
I am a lily and my Shepherd He;
May daybreak come, the shadows flee away,
Him on the mountains as a hart I'd see.

Myrrh of the death with Him and frankincense,
The resurrection, permeate my heart;
North wind awake, and let the south wind blow,
Make my heart's garden pleasure to His heart.

I'd be to Him a dove that's undefiled,
As a pure lily in His presence be,
His, wholly His, the joy of all His joys,
He wholly mine, the Song of songs to me.

Fair as the moon, conformed to Him I'd be,
Clear as the sun, unto His stature grown;
For my Beloved, all to please His heart,
For my Beloved, that His life be shown.

Thou art my life, and I Thine image real;
Love in such union is as death most strong,
Ne'er can it be destroyed or e'er replaced
Till Thou on spices mountains come ere long.--------557
Jesus Himself drew near,
And joined them as they walked,
And soon their hearts began to burn,
As of Himself He talked:
Draw near, O Lord.

Jesus Himself drew near,
They were no longer sad;
When He was walking at their side,
How could they but be glad?
Draw near, O Lord.

Jesus Himself drew near,
And all their doubts were solved;
He showed them why Christ came to die,
And what that death involved:
Draw near, O Lord.

Jesus Himself drew near,
And at the journey's end
They could not let Him leave them thus,
The Stranger was their Friend:
Draw near, O Lord.--------558
What a fellowship, what a joy divine,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!
What a blessedness, what a peace is mine,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

O how sweet to walk in this pilgrim way,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!
O how bright the path grows from day to day,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

What have I to dread, what have I to fear,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!
I have peace complete with my Lord so near,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!

Leaning, leaning,
Safe and secure from all alarms;
Leaning, leaning,
Leaning on the Everlasting Arms!--------559

  By Thy Spirit's burning flame;
  Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
  Glory to Thy Holy Name!--------560
Come, O Thou Traveler unknown,
Whom still I hold but cannot see;
My company before is gone,
And I am left alone with Thee;
With Thee all night I mean to stay,
And wrestle till the break of day.

I need not tell Thee who I am,
My sin and misery declare;
Thyself hast called me by my name,
Look on Thy hands, and read it there;
But who, I ask Thee, who art Thou?
Tell me Thy name, and tell me now.

In vain Thou strugglest to get free;
I never will unloose my hold;
Art Thou the Man that died for me?
The secret of Thy love unfold;
Wrestling, I will not let Thee go,
Till I Thy name, Thy nature know.

Yield to me now, for I am weak,
But confident in self-despair;
Speak to my heart, in blessings speak,
Be conquered by my instant prayer;
Speak, or Thou never hence shalt move,
And tell me if Thy name be Love.

'Tis Love! 'Tis Love! Thou diedst for me;
I hear Thy whisper in my heart;
The morning breaks, the shadows flee:
Pure, universal Love Thou art;
To me, to all Thy mercies move;
Thy nature and Thy name is Love.

Lame as I am, I take the prey;
Hell, earth and sin, with ease o'ercome.
I leap for joy, pursue my way,
And, as a bounding hart, I run,
Through all eternity to prove
Thy nature and Thy name is Love.--------561
Thou hast said Thou art the Vine, Lord,
And that I'm a branch in Thee,
But I do not know the reason
Why I should so barren be.

Bearing fruit is my deep longing,
More Thy life to manifest,
To Thy throne to bring more glory,
That Thy will may be expressed.

But I fail to understand, Lord,
What it means  "abide in me"
For the more I seek "abiding,"
More I feel I'm not in Thee.

How I feel I'm not abiding;
Though I pray and strongly will,
Yet from me Thou seemest distant
And my life is barren still.

Yet Thou art the Vine, Thou saidst it,
And I am a branch in Thee;
When I take Thee as my Savior,
Then this fact is wrought in me.

Now I'm in Thee and I need not
Seek into Thyself to come,
For I'm joined to Thee already,
With Thy flesh and bones I'm one.

Not to "go in" is the secret,
But that I'm "already in"!
That I ne'er may leave I'd ask Thee,
Not how I may get within.

I am in, already in Thee!
What a place to which I'm brought!
There's no need for prayer or struggling,
God Himself the work has wrought.

Since I'm in, why ask to enter;
O how ignorant I've been!
Now with praise and much rejoicing
For Thy Word, I dwell therein.

10 Now in Thee I rest completely,
With myself I gladly part;
Thou art life and Thou art power,
All in all to me Thou art.--------562
Abiding, oh, so wondrous sweet,
I'm resting at the Savior's feet;
I trust in Him, I'm satisfied,
I'm resting in the Crucified.

  Abiding, abiding,
  Oh! so wondrous sweet;
  I'm resting, resting
  At the Savior's feet.

He speaks, and by His word is giv'n
His peace, a blessed gift from heav'n;
Not as the world He peace doth give,
'Tis through this hope my soul shall live.

  Abiding, abiding,
  Oh! so wondrous sweet;
  I'm resting, resting
  At the Savior's feet.

I live; not I; 'tis He alone
By whom the mighty work is done;
Dead to myself, alive to Him,
I count all loss His rest to gain.

  Abiding, abiding,
  Oh! so wondrous sweet;
  I'm resting, resting
  At the Savior's feet.

Now rest, my heart, the work is done,
I'm saved through the Eternal Son;
Let all my pow'rs my soul employ,
To tell the world my peace and joy.

  Abiding, abiding,
  Oh! so wondrous sweet;
  I'm resting, resting
  At the Savior's feet.--------563
Abide in Thee! in that deep love of Thine,
My Jesus, Lord, Thou Lamb of God divine,
Down, closely down, as living branch with tree,
I would abide, my Lord, my Christ, in Thee.

Abide in Thee! my Savior God, I know
How love of Thine so vast in me may flow,
My empty vessel, running o'er with joy,
Must overflow to Thee without alloy.

Abide in Thee! nor doubt, nor self, nor sin,
Can e'er prevail with Thy blest life within;
Joined to Thyself, communing deep, my soul
Knows naught besides its motions to control.

Abide in Thee! 'tis thus I only know
The secrets of Thy mind e'en while below
All joy and peace, and knowledge of Thy word,
All pow'r and fruit, and service for the Lord.--------564
I have learned the wondrous secret
Of abiding in the Lord;
I have tasted life's pure fountain,
I am drinking of His word;
I have found the strength and sweetness
Of abiding 'neath the blood;
I have lost myself in Jesus,
I am sinking into God.

  I'm abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word;
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
  Yes, abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word,
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

I am crucified with Jesus,
And He lives and dwells with me;
I have ceased from all my struggling,
'Tis no longer I, but He.
All my will is yielding to Him,
And His Spirit reigns within;
And His precious blood each moment
Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.

  I'm abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word;
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
  Yes, abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word,
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

All my sicknesses I bring Him,
And He bears them all away;
All my fears and griefs I tell Him,
All my cares from day to day,
All my strength I draw from Jesus,
By His breath I live and move;
E'en His very mind He gives me,
And His faith, and life, and love.

  I'm abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word;
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
  Yes, abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word,
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.

For my words I take His wisdom,
For my works His Spirit's power;
For my ways His ceaseless presence
Guards and guides me every hour.
Of my heart, He is the portion,
Of my joy the boundless spring;
Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,
Glorious Lord, and coming King.

  I'm abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word;
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
  Yes, abiding in the Lord
  And confiding in His word,
  I am hiding in the bosom of His love.--------565
Under His wings I am safely abiding;
Though the night deepens and tempests are wild,
Still I can trust Him, I know He will keep me;
He has redeemed me, and I am His child.

  Under His wings, under His wings,
  Who from His love can sever?
  Under His wings my soul shall abide,
  Safely abide forever.

Under His wings  what a refuge in sorrow!
How the heart yearningly turns to His rest!
Often when earth has no balm for my healing,
There I find comfort, and there I am blest.

  Under His wings, under His wings,
  Who from His love can sever?
  Under His wings my soul shall abide,
  Safely abide forever.

Under His wings  oh, what precious enjoyment!
There will I hide till life's trials are o'er;
Sheltered, protected, no evil can harm me;
Resting in Jesus I'm safe evermore.

  Under His wings, under His wings,
  Who from His love can sever?
  Under His wings my soul shall abide,
  Safely abide forever.--------566
Oh, safe to the Rock that is higher than I,
My soul in its conflicts and sorrows would fly,
So sinful, so weary, Thine, Thine would I be,
Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.

  Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
  Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.

In the calm of the noontide, in sorrow's lone hour,
In times when temptation casts o'er me its power;
In the tempest of life, on its wide, heaving sea,
Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.

  Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
  Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.

How oft in the conflict, when pressed by the foe,
I have fled to my Refuge and breathed out my woe;
How often, when trials like sea-billows roll,
Have I hidden in Thee, O Thou Rock of my soul.

  Hiding in Thee, hiding in Thee,
  Thou blest Rock of Ages, I'm hiding in Thee.--------567
O Lamb of God, still keep me
Close to Thy wounded side;
'Tis only there in safety
And peace I can abide.

What foes and snares surround me,
What lusts and fears within;
The grace that sought and found me
Alone can keep me clean.

'Tis only in Thee hiding
I feel myself secure;
Only in Thee abiding,
The conflict can endure;

Thine arm the victory gaineth
O'er every hateful foe;
Thy love my heart sustaineth
In all its care and woe.

Soon shall my eyes behold Thee,
With rapture face to face;
One half hath not been told me
Of all Thy power and grace;

The beauty, Lord, and glory,
The wonders of Thy love,
Shall be the endless story
Of all Thy saints above.--------568
'Tis so sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to take Him at His word;
Just to rest upon His promise;
Just to know, Thus saith the Lord.

  Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
  How I've proved Him o'er and o'er,
  Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.

O how sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just to trust His cleansing blood;
Just in simple faith to plunge me,
'Neath the healing, cleansing flood.

  Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
  How I've proved Him o'er and o'er,
  Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.

Yes, 'tis sweet to trust in Jesus,
Just from sin and self to cease;
Just from Jesus simply taking
Life, and rest, and joy, and peace.

  Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
  How I've proved Him o'er and o'er,
  Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.

I'm so glad I learned to trust Thee,
Precious Jesus, Savior, Friend;
And I know that Thou art with me,
Wilt be with me to the end.

  Jesus, Jesus, how I trust Him,
  How I've proved Him o'er and o'er,
  Jesus, Jesus, Precious Jesus!
  O for grace to trust Him more.--------569
Simply trusting every day;
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

  Trusting as the moments fly,
  Trusting as the days go by,
  Trusting Him, whate'er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

  Trusting as the moments fly,
  Trusting as the days go by,
  Trusting Him, whate'er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

  Trusting as the moments fly,
  Trusting as the days go by,
  Trusting Him, whate'er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.

Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

  Trusting as the moments fly,
  Trusting as the days go by,
  Trusting Him, whate'er befall,
  Trusting Jesus, that is all.--------570
All my doubts I give to Jesus;
I've His gracious promise heard:
I shall never be confounded,
I am trusting in that word.

  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word.

All my sins I lay on Jesus,
He doth wash me in His blood,
He will keep me pure and holy,
He will keep me close to God.

  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word.

All my fears I give to Jesus,
Rests my weary soul on Him;
Though my way be hid in darkness,
Never can His light grow dim.

  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word.

All my joys I give to Jesus,
He is all I want of bliss;
He of all the worlds is Master;
He has all I need in this.

  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word.

All I am I give to Jesus;
All my body, all my soul;
All I have, and all I hope for;
While eternal ages roll.

  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word;
  I am trusting, fully trusting,
  Sweetly trusting in His word.--------571
Thou whose name is calld Jesus,
Risen Lord of life and pow'r,
Oh, it is so sweet to trust Thee,
Every day and every hour;
Of Thy wondrous grace I sing,
Savior, Counsellor, and King.

Thou canst keep my feet from falling,
Even my poor wayward feet;
Thou who dost present me faultless
In Thee  Righteousness complete;
Jesus, Lord, in knowing Thee,
Oh, what strength and victory.

All the sin in me, my Savior,
Thou canst conquer and subdue;
With Thy sanctifying power
Permeate my spirit through;
Let Thy government increase,
Risen, crownd, Prince of Peace.

Thou canst keep my upward looking,
Ever upward in Thy face;
Thou canst make me stand, upholden
By the greatness of Thy grace;
Every promise of Thy word
Now I claim from Thee, dear Lord.

Oh! what joy to trust Thee, Jesus,
Mighty Victor o'er the grave,
And to learn amid earth's shadows
Thine unceasing power to save!
Only those who prove Thee know
What the grace Thou dost bestow.

Make my life a bright outshining
Of Thy life, that all my see
Thine own resurrection power
Mightily put forth in me;
Ever let my heart become
Yet more consciously Thy home.--------572
Jesus hath died and hath risen again,
Pardon and peace to bestow;
Fully I trust Him; from sin's guilty stain,
Jesus saves me now.

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;

Sin's condemnation is over and gone,
Jesus alone knoweth how;
Life and salvation my soul hath put on:
Jesus saves me now.

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;

Satan may tempt, but he never shall reign,
That Christ will never allow;
Doubts I have buried, and this is my strain,
Jesus saves me now.

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;

Resting in Jesus, abiding in Him,
Gladly in faith can avow,
Never again need my pathway be dim:
Jesus saves me now.

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;

Jesus is stronger than Satan and sin,
Satan to Jesus must bow;
Therefore I triumph without and within:
Jesus saves me now.

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;

Sorrow and pain may beset me about,
Nothing can darken my brow;
Battling in faith, I can joyfully shout:
"Jesus saves me now."

  Jesus saves me now,
  Jesus saves me now;
  Yes, Jesus saves me all the time;
  Jesus saves me now;--------573
Once I thought I walked with Jesus,
Yet such changeful feelings had;
Sometimes trusting, sometimes doubting,
Sometimes joyful, sometimes sad.

  Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
  Peace I never knew before;
  And my way has brighter grown
  Since I've learned to trust Him more.

But He call'd me closer to Him,
Bade my doubting, fearing, cease;
And when I had fully yielded,
Filled my soul with perfect peace.

  Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
  Peace I never knew before;
  And my way has brighter grown
  Since I've learned to trust Him more.

Now I'm trusting every moment,
Nothing less can be enough;
And the Savior bears me gently
O'er those places once so rough.

  Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
  Peace I never knew before;
  And my way has brighter grown
  Since I've learned to trust Him more.

Day by day my soul He's keeping
By His wondrous power within;
And my heart is full of singing
To my Savior from all sin.

  Oh, the peace the Savior gives!
  Peace I never knew before;
  And my way has brighter grown
  Since I've learned to trust Him more.--------574
Lord Jesus, Thou dost keep Thy child
Thru sunshine or thru tempests wild;
Jesus, I trust in Thee:
Thine is such wondrous pow'r to save;
Thine is the mighty love that gave
Its all on Calvary.

O glorious Savior, Thee I praise;
To Thee my new glad song I raise,
And tell of what Thou art.
Thy grace is boundless in its store;
Thy face of love shines evermore;
Thou givest me Thy heart.

Upon Thy promises I stand,
Trusting in Thee: Thine own right hand
Doth keep and comfort me;
My soul doth triumph in Thy word;
Thine, Thine be all the praise, dear Lord,
As Thine the victory.

Love perfecteth what it begins;
Thy power doth save me from my sins;
Thy grace upholdeth me.
This life of trust, how glad, how sweet;
My need and Thy great fulness meet,
And I have all in Thee.--------575
I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length,
And breadth and fulness, as my daily strength;
Into life's future fearless I may gaze,
For, Savior, Thou art with me all the days.

Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,
New scenes surround my life and fancies strange;
I thank Thee that no day can ever break,
Savior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake.

There may be days of darkness and distress,
When sin has power to tempt, and care to press,
Yet in the darkest day I will not fear,
For, 'mid the shadows, Thou wilt still be near.

Days there may be of joy and deep delight,
When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,
Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest
Elsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast.

And all the other days that make my life,
Marked by no special joy or grief or strife,
Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care,
Burdens too small for other hearts to share;

Spend Thou these days with me, all shall be Thine,
So shall the darkest hour with glory shine.
Then when these earthly years have passed away,
Let me be with Thee in the perfect day.--------576
I clasp the hand of Love divine,
I claim the gracious promise mine,
And add to His my countersign,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.

I take salvation full and free,
Through Him who gave His life for me,
He undertakes my all to be,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.

I take Him as my holiness,
My spirit's spotless, heavenly dress,
I take the Lord, my righteousness,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.

I take the promised Holy Ghost,
I take the power of Pentecost,
To fill me to the uttermost,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.

I take Him for this mortal frame,
I take my healing through His Name,
And all His risen life I claim,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.

I simply take Him at His word,
I praise Him that my prayer is heard,
And claim my answer from the Lord,
"I take"  "He undertakes."

  I take Thee, blessed Lord,
  I give myself to Thee,
  And Thou, according to Thy word,
  Dost undertake for me.--------577
When I fear my faith will fail,
Christ will hold me fast;
When the tempter would prevail,
He can hold me fast.

  He will hold me fast,
  He will hold me fast;
  For my Savior loves me so,
  He will hold me fast.

I could never keep my hold,
He will hold me fast;
For my love is often cold,
He must hold me fast.

  He will hold me fast,
  He will hold me fast;
  For my Savior loves me so,
  He will hold me fast.

I am precious in His sight,
He will hold me fast;
Those He saves are His delight,
He will hold me fast.

  He will hold me fast,
  He will hold me fast;
  For my Savior loves me so,
  He will hold me fast.

He'll not let my soul be lost,
Christ will hold me fast;
Bought by Him at such as cost,
He will hold me fast.

  He will hold me fast,
  He will hold me fast;
  For my Savior loves me so,
  He will hold me fast.--------578
My will is weak, my strength is frail,
And all my hope is nearly gone;
I can but trust Thy working true
To gently hold and lead me on.

I've tried my best, but still have failed,
E'en as before I've failed and erred;
Thy patience is my only trust
To hold and keep me to Thy word.

When'er my heart is lifted up,
How very near I am to fall;
I dare not do, I dare not think,
I need Thyself in great or small.

Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,
O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;
Though I'm the weakest of the weak,
My strength is nothing but Thy grace.--------579
Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul,
For, by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.

  Jesus! I am resting, resting
  In the joy of what Thou art;
  I am finding out the greatness
  Of Thy loving heart.

Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea;
Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
Know Thy certainty of promise,
And have made it mine.

  Jesus! I am resting, resting
  In the joy of what Thou art;
  I am finding out the greatness
  Of Thy loving heart.

Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,
Satisfies my heart,
Satisfies its deepest longings,
Meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings,
Thine is love indeed.

  Jesus! I am resting, resting
  In the joy of what Thou art;
  I am finding out the greatness
  Of Thy loving heart.

Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting 'neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
Earth's dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father's glory,
Sunshine of my Father's face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting,
Fill me with Thy grace.

  Jesus! I am resting, resting
  In the joy of what Thou art;
  I am finding out the greatness
  Of Thy loving heart.--------580
Resting on the faithfulness of Christ our Lord,
Resting on the fulness of His own sure word,
Resting on His wisdom, on His love and pow'r,
Resting on His covenant from hour to hour.

Resting 'neath His guiding hand for untrack'd days,
Resting 'neath His shadow from noontide rays,
Resting at the eventide beneath His wing,
In the glorious presence of our Savior King.

Resting in the fortress while the foe is nigh,
Resting in the lifeboat while the waves roll high,
Resting in His chariot for the swift, glad race,
Resting, always resting, in His boundless grace.

Resting in the pastures and beneath the Rock,
Resting by the waters where He leads His flock,
Resting, while we listen, at His glorious feet,
Resting in His very arms, oh, rest complete!

Resting and believing, let us onward press;
Resting on Himself, the Lord our righteousness;
Resting and rejoicing, let His saved ones sing,
Glory, glory, glory be to Christ our King!--------581
On Thee my heart is resting,
Ah, this is rest indeed:
What else, Almighty Savior,
Can a poor sinner need?
Thy light is all my wisdom,
Thy love is all my stay;
Thy coming back in glory,
Draws nearer every day.

  On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
  What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?

My guilt is great, but greater
The mercy Thou dost give;
Thyself, a spotless Off'ring,
Hast died that I should live.
With Thee, my soul unfettered
Has risen from the dust;
Thy blood is all my treasure,
Thy word is all my trust.

  On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
  What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?

Through me, Thou gentle Master,
Thy purposes fulfil;
I yield myself forever
To Thy most holy will.
What though I be but weakness?
My strength is not in me;
The poorest of Thy people
Has all things, having Thee.

  On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
  What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?

When clouds are darkest round me,
Thou, Lord, art then most near,
My drooping faith to quicken,
My weary soul to cheer.
Safe nestling in Thy bosom,
I gaze upon Thy face;
In vain my foes would drive me
From Thee, my hiding-place.

  On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
  What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?

'Tis Thou hast made me happy,
'Tis Thou hast set me free;
To whom shall I give glory
Forever, but to Thee?
Of earthly love and blessing
Should every stream run dry,
Thy grace shall still be with me,
Thy grace, to live and die.

  On Thee my heart is resting,
  Ah, this is rest indeed:
  What else, Almighty Savior,
  Can a poor sinner need?--------582
When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way;
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.

  Trust and obey,
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.

  Trust and obey,
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.

  Trust and obey,
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.

But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.

  Trust and obey,
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we'll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do;
Where He sends we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.

  Trust and obey,
  For there's no other way
  To be happy in Jesus,
  But to trust and obey.--------583
Go to Him "without the camp,"
His reproach to gladly bear.
Suffered He without the gate,
How can I in comfort share?

Go to Him "without the camp,"
Willing e'en to bear the cross;
He has trod the narrow way,
I will follow, suff'ring loss.

Go to Him "without the camp,"
Dear ones, relatives forsake;
He the Father's will did mind,
In His passion I partake.

Go to Him "without the camp,"
His companion I will be;
Never join religion's ranks
Or the world's society.

Go to Him "without the camp,"
Though the path be lone and grim;
Let all human friends desert,
I am satisfied with Him.

Go to Him "without the camp,"
There to walk with Him, how blest!
E'er to see His smiling face
Ever in His presence rest.

Go to Him "without the camp,"
Till the dawning of the day;
Then I'll see Him and rejoice,
With Him in His kingdom stay.--------584
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go,
Anywhere He leads me in this world below.
Anywhere without Him, dearest joys would fade;
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid.

  Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

Anywhere with Jesus I am not alone,
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own.
Though His hand may lead me over dreary ways,
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise.

  Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.

Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep,
When the darkling shadows round about me creep;
Knowing I shall waken never more to roam,
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home.

  Anywhere! Anywhere! Fear I cannot know.
  Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go.--------585
He leadeth me! O blessed thought,
O words with heav'nly comfort fraught;
Whate'er I do, where'er I be,
Still 'tis Christ's hand that leadeth me.

  He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
  By His own hand He leadeth me;
  His faithful follower I would be,
  For by His hand He leadeth me.

Sometimes 'mid scenes of deepest gloom,
Sometimes where Eden's bowers bloom,
By waters still, o'er troubled sea,
Still 'tis His hand that leadeth me.

  He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
  By His own hand He leadeth me;
  His faithful follower I would be,
  For by His hand He leadeth me.

Lord, I would clasp Thy hand in mine,
Nor ever murmur or repine;
Content, whatever lot I see,
Since it is Thou that leadest me.

  He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
  By His own hand He leadeth me;
  His faithful follower I would be,
  For by His hand He leadeth me.

And when my task on earth is done,
When, by Thy grace, the vict'ry's won,
E'en death's cold wave I will not flee,
Since Thou in triumph leadest me.

  He leadeth me! He leadeth me!
  By His own hand He leadeth me;
  His faithful follower I would be,
  For by His hand He leadeth me.--------586
I can hear my Savior calling,
In the tend'rest accents calling;
On my ear these words are falling,
"Take thy cross, and daily follow me."

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

Though the way be dark and dreary,
Though my feet be worn and weary,
Yet my heart keeps bright and cheery
As I follow, follow all the way.

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

Savior, ever go before me,
Shining heaven's sunlight o'er me,
And when weak, by grace restore me
As I follow, follow all the way.

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

Through the valley safely lead me,
Heav'nly manna daily feed me;
Every hour, dear Lord, I need Thee
As I follow, follow all the way.

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

In Thy heart's affection hold me,
In Thy arms of love enfold me,
And with Thine own grace uphold me,
As I follow, follow all the way.

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.

I would never leave Thee, never;
Faithful I would be forever;
Nothing from Thy love can sever
As I follow, follow all the way.

  I will take my cross and follow,
  My dear Savior I will follow,
  Where He leads me I will follow,
  I'll go with Him, with Him all the way.--------587
'Tis so sweet to walk with Jesus,
Step by step and day by day;
Stepping in His very footprints,
Walking with Him all the way.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

'Tis so safe to walk with Jesus,
Leaning hard upon His arm,
Following closely where He leads us,
None can hurt and naught can harm.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

Step by step I'll walk with Jesus,
Just a moment at a time,
Heights I have not wings to soar to,
Step by step my feet can climb.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

All the way I'll walk with Jesus,
Through the sunshine, through the gloom,
Though His blood-marked steps may lead me
To the garden, to the tomb.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

Here a while we walk with Jesus,
But the time will not be long
Till the night shall change to morning,
And the sorrow into song.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

Then, with all who walked with Jesus,
We shall walk with Him in white,
While He turns our grief to gladness,
And our darkness into light.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.

Jesus, keep me closer  closer,
Step by step, and day by day;
Stepping in Thy very footprints,
Walking with Thee all the way.

  Step by step, step by step,
  I would walk with Jesus,
  All the day, all the way,
  Keeping step with Jesus.--------588
O blessed life  the heart at rest
When all without tumultuous seems,
That trusts a higher will, and deems
That higher will, not mine, the best.

O blessed life, the mind that sees,
Whatever change the years may bring,
A mercy still in everything,
And shining through all mysteries.

O blessed life, as spirit soars,
When sense of mortal sight is dim,
Beyond the sense, beyond to Him,
Whose love unlocks the glorious doors.

O blessed life, heart, mind, and soul,
From self-born aims and wishes free,
In all at one with Deity,
And loyal to the Lord's control.

O life, how blessed, how divine,
High life, the earnest of a higher;
Savior, fulfil my deep desire,
And let this blessed life be mine.--------589
God in heaven hath a treasure,
Riches none may count or tell;
Hath a deep eternal pleasure,
Christ the Son, He loveth well.
God hath here on earth a treasure,
None but He its price may know
Deep, unfathomable pleasure,
Christ revealed in saints below.

God in tongues of fire descending,
Chosen vessels thus to fill
With the treasure never ending,
Ever spent  unfailing still.
God's own hand the vessel filling
From the glory far above,
Longing hearts forever stilling
With the riches of His love.

Thus though worn, and tried, and tempted,
Glorious calling, saint, is thine;
Let the Lord but find thee emptied,
Living branch in Christ the Vine!
Vessels of the world's despising,
Vessels weak and poor and base,
Bearing wealth God's heart is prizing,
Glory from Christ's blessed face.

Oh to be but emptier, lowlier,
Mean, unnoticed  and unknown,
And to God a vessel holier,
Filled with Christ and Christ alone!
Naught of earth to cloud the glory,
Naught of self the light to dim,
Telling forth His wondrous story,
Emptied to be filled with Him.--------590
Lo, from vessels, earthen only,
Shining forth in ceaseless grace,
Reaching weary hearts, and lonely,
Beams the light from Jesus' face!

Christ, the light that fills the heavens
Shining forth on earth beneath,
Through His Spirit freely given
Light of life 'midst shades of death;

Down from heaven's unclouded glory
God Himself the treasure brought,
Closing thus His love's sweet story
With His sweetest, deepest thought.

Earthen vessels, marred, unsightly,
But the treasure as of old,
Fresh from glory, gleaming brightly,
Heaven's undimmed, unchanging gold.

Vessels, broken, frail, yet bearing
Through the hungry ages on
Riches giv'n with hand unsparing
God's great Gift, His precious Son!--------591
Not I, but Christ be honored, loved, exalted,
Not I, but Christ be seen, be known and heard;
Not I, but Christ in every look and action,
Not I, but Christ in every thought and word.

  Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
  Oh, to be lost in Thee,
  Oh, that it may be no more I,
  But Christ that lives in me.

Not I, but Christ to gently soothe in sorrow,
Not I, but Christ to wipe the falling tear;
Not I, but Christ to lift the weary burden,
Not I, but Christ to hush away all fear.

  Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
  Oh, to be lost in Thee,
  Oh, that it may be no more I,
  But Christ that lives in me.

Christ, only Christ, no idle word e'er falling,
Christ, only Christ, no needless bustling sound;
Christ, only Christ, no self-important bearing,
Christ, only Christ, no trace of I be found.

  Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
  Oh, to be lost in Thee,
  Oh, that it may be no more I,
  But Christ that lives in me.

Not I, but Christ my every need supplying,
Not I, but Christ my strength and health to be;
Christ, only Christ, for spirit, soul, and body,
Christ, only Christ, live then Thy life in me.

  Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
  Oh, to be lost in Thee,
  Oh, that it may be no more I,
  But Christ that lives in me.

Christ, only Christ, ere long will fill my vision,
Glory excelling soon, full soon I'll see;
Christ, only Christ, my every wish fulfilling,
Christ, only Christ, my all in all to be.

  Oh, to be saved from myself, dear Lord,
  Oh, to be lost in Thee,
  Oh, that it may be no more I,
  But Christ that lives in me.--------592
The earth absorbs the soft, refreshing rain,
And sends it back in flow'rs and fruits again;
So we receive Thy life so rich and free,
And live it out for joy and praise to Thee.

The moon receives the sun's bright, golden light,
And gives it forth to cheer the darksome night;
So we receive the rays of light Divine,
And with them on this darkened world we shine.

'Tis by Thy love that I can love and bless
The foes who seek to blast my happiness;
Can e'en rejoice, when bearing wrong and shame,
Thou deem'st me meet to suffer for Thy name.

Naught but Thyself can satisfy my heart,
Constrain my will from self and sin to part:
In love so great Thou giv'st Thyself to me;
That I may Thee express eternally.--------593
All I have in Adam is but sin and death,
I in Christ inherit life and righteousness;
When in flesh abiding, Adam I express,
But when in the spirit Christ is manifest.

When I am in Adam, though I may not sin,
Unto death, a sinner, sentenced I have been;
When in Christ I need not righteously to act,
I'm already righteous, justified in fact.

In the flesh I need no effort to express
Marks of Adam's nature and its sinfulness;
In the spirit I need not to strive or strain,
I can live as He is and in spirit reign.

Thru my death with Christ, from Adam I am free,
Thru my life with Christ, new life is given me!
Minding not the flesh, old Adam cannot move,
Minding just the spirit, life divine I prove.

Minding just the spirit is God's saving way,
Minding just the spirit, Christ we will display;
Minding just the spirit, we can overcome,
Minding just the spirit, we the race may run.

Minding just the spirit, we the cross will know,
And His resurrection pow'r thru us will flow;
Minding just the spirit, Christ will live thru me,
And His life within will reach maturity.

In the spirit Christ is life and all to me,
Strengthening and blessing all-inclusively;
Living in the spirit, holiness I prove,
And the triune God within my heart doth move.--------594
Christ my very peace is
And my life within;
Sharing in the spirit
I unite with Him.

  Following the Spirit,
  Living in the Lord,
  Life He doth supply me
  And His peace afford.

To the Lord belonging,
Bound I'll never be,
For the law of life now
Sets me wholly free.

  Following the Spirit,
  Living in the Lord,
  Life He doth supply me
  And His peace afford.

Minding flesh no longer,
I'll the spirit mind;
Self-will never follow,
But the Spirit's find.

  Following the Spirit,
  Living in the Lord,
  Life He doth supply me
  And His peace afford.

Christ within empow'rs me
Spiritual to be!
E'en my body quick'ning
By His pow'r in me.

  Following the Spirit,
  Living in the Lord,
  Life He doth supply me
  And His peace afford.

Spirit with the spirit
Witnesseth in one,
I'm of God begotten,
Heir with Christ the Son.

  Following the Spirit,
  Living in the Lord,
  Life He doth supply me
  And His peace afford.--------595
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

There is always something over,
When we taste our gracious Lord;
Every cup He fills o'erfloweth,
Rich supply He doth afford.
Nothing narrow, nothing stinted,
Ever issued from His store;
To His own He gives full measure,
Running over, evermore.

There is always something over,
When we, from the Father's hand,
Take our portion with thanksgiving,
Praising for the things He planned.
Satisfaction, full and deepening,
All our need He doth supply.
When the heart has tasted Jesus
Its desires to satisfy.

There is always something over,
When we share in all His love;
Unplumbed depths still lie beneath us,
Unscaled heights rise far above.
Human lips can never utter
All His wondrous tenderness.
We can only praise and wonder
And His Name forever bless.--------596
Mine is the earth, the worlds in all their fulness;
Mine, every ocean, river, plain, and hill;
Mine are the stars within the heaven's stillness,
Mine are the clouds that wander at their will.

Mine is the spring, when blossoms sweet are blowing,
Wakened from slumb'ring neath the winter snow;
Mine, summer's wealth, with her bright colors glowing;
Mine is the fruit rich autumn doth bestow.

Mine, all the things created: praise the Giver!
Fish, and all beasts, the birds upon the wing,
Sun-loving butterflies  now and forever;
Beauty and grace of every living thing.

Mine, all things lovely, blessing every hour,
Wealth of creation, over and around;
Mine is the sun, with its life-giving power,
Mine is the music wonderful of sound.

Mine are the pillars which cannot be shaken
Truth in the Word, the Word that cannot fall.
Mine is the wisdom which great thoughts awaken
In a man's soul, that this life is not all.

Knowledge as needed, skill in all the doing,
Mine, when kept closely for my Lord above;
Beauty and wisdom, living streams e'er flowing
Fresh from the springs of God, the God of love.

Mine are the battles, triumph-shouts e'er ringing
Joy of the warriors for the truth and right;
Mine are the trophies God's brave ones are bringing,
Heroes of faith and overcoming might.

Mine, mercies granted, and each new awaking,
Every experience, and each soul that's won;
Mine, the confessions sinners poor are making,
Yea, I am joined with them, one in God's Son.

One Lord in all, and all one in His Spirit,
Heavenly fellowship earth has not known;
Faith sees the riches we shall yet inherit,
Glorious treasure laid up for His own.

10 All in the bounds of earth and sea and heaven,
Creation's wonders and Thy grace are stored:
Praise to Thee, Christ, for all the wealth
Thou'st given!
Poor in myself, but wealthy in the Lord!--------597
I know that my Redeemer lives
And ever prays for me;
A token of His love He gives,
A pledge of liberty.

I know that my Redeemer lives,
A quick'ning Spirit He;
I know eternal life He gives
Amazing grace  to me.

I find Him lifting up my head;
He brings salvation near;
His presence make me free indeed,
And He will soon appear.

He wills that I should holy be:
What can withstand His will?
The counsel of His grace in me
He surely shall fulfill.

Jesus, I hang upon Thy word:
I steadfastly believe
Thou wilt return and claim me, Lord,
And to Thyself receive.--------598
All fair within those children of the light,
Though dark their brows beneath the desert sun;
Mysterious joys, far hidden from all sight,
The King of Glory giveth to each one;
No thought of man has pictured them,
No hand may touch that diadem;
Within God's light His own abide
With hidden glory glorified.

To earthly eyes they are as Adam's race
They wear the earthly form, and scars of pain
On them as on all sinners leave their trace;
Their outward needs are those of other men.
And theirs the forms of earthly life,
Theirs sleeping, waking, want, and strife,
Yet this they have that they despise
What fairest seems to earthly eyes.

And inwardly their life is from above,
The Lord's Almighty Word hath quickened them;
Flames kindled from the everlasting Love,
The children of the New Jerusalem;
Their brethren are the saints in light,
And songs of sweetness infinite
They sing with them to God Most High,
A deep and wondrous melody.

They walk upon the earth, and dwell in heaven,
Though pow'rless, guard the world with arms unseen;
Deep peace to them in midst of strife is given,
And all they wish they have, though poor and mean.
Storms beat them, but may not destroy,
Fast rooted in eternal joy;
They walk as in the shade of death,
Yet living on in silent faith.

When Christ their Life shall be made manifest,
When He shall come with all His pow'r to rule,
Their glory, hidden long, shall be confessed;
Arise and shine! O bright and beautiful!
With Christ ye shall ascend on high,
Victorious in His victory
The hidden light shall shine afar,
Each saint an everlasting star.--------599
Lord, I was blind; I could not see
In Thy marred visage any grace,
But now the beauty of Thy face
In radiant vision dawns on me.

Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear
The thrilling music of Thy voice;
But now I hear Thee and rejoice,
And all Thine uttered words are dear!

Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak
The grace and glory of Thy name;
But now, as touched with living flame,
My lips Thine eager praises wake.

Lord, I was dead; I could not stir
My lifeless soul to come to Thee;
But now, since Thou hast quickened me,
I rise from sin's dark sepulcher.

For Thou hast made the blind to see,
The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
The dead to live; and, lo, I break
The chains of my captivity.--------600
My God, my Portion, and my Love,
My everlasting All,
I've none but Thee in heav'n above,
Or on this earthly ball,
Or on this earthly ball.

What empty things are all the skies,
And this inferior clod!
There's nothing here deserves my joys,
There's nothing like my God,
There's nothing like my God.

To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
And health, and safe abode;
Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
But they are not my God,
But they are not my God.

How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
If once compared to Thee!
Or what's my safety, or my health,
Or all my friends to me,
Or all my friends to me.

Were I possessor of the earth,
And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
I were a wretch undone,
I were a wretch undone.

Let others stretch their arms like seas,
And grasp in all the shore;
Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
And I desire no more,
And I desire no more.--------601
My heart is resting, O my God,
I will give thanks and sing;
My heart is at the secret source
Of every precious thing.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

Now this frail vessel Thou hast made,
No hand but Thine shall fill;
The waters of the earth have failed,
And I am thirsty still.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

I thirst for springs of heavenly life,
And here all day they rise;
I seek the treasure of Thy love,
And close at hand it lies.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

A glad, new song is in my mouth,
To long-loved music set,
A song of praise for all the grace
I have not tasted yet.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

I have a heritage of joy
That yet I must not see;
The hand that bled to make it mine
Is keeping it for me.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

There is a certainty of love
That sets my heart at rest;
A calm assurance for today
That to be poor is best.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.

A prayer reposing on His truth,
Who hath made all things mine;
That draws my captive will to Him,
And makes it one with Thine.

  Oh, peace of God that passeth thought,
  I daily, hourly sing;
  My heart is at the secret source
  Of every precious thing.--------602
O how glorious! O how holy!
God is the eternal life!
Full, unlimited, and pow'rful,
Pure, and merciful, and bright!
In this life are all His riches,
All His nature, love and light.

O how loving! O how gracious!
God Himself is life to man!
He in man hath made a spirit
That He might fulfill His plan.
'Tis His heart's delight and longing
E'er to be received by man.

O what love and grace unbounded!
God as life to man doth flow!
He no more is hid in secret
But Himself to man doth show,
First in flesh and then as Spirit
That His life all men may know.

How approachable! How near us!
God in Christ our life to be!
Christ is God in flesh incarnate,
Manifest for man to see.
Died and risen, now He enters
Into man, his life to be.

O what wonder! As the Spirit
God as life to man is shown!
'Tis His other transformation,
He as Spirit thus is known;
Men convicting and inspiring,
He within them makes His home.

O how glorious! O how precious!
Thus the triune God to know!
First the Father in the Son came,
Now the Son as Spirit flows.
When in man the Spirit enters
God as life He doth bestow.

How mysterious, yet how real!
God Himself now flows in me!
In my heart, with me in oneness,
He has come my life to be.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I will praise unceasingly!--------603
Eternal Light! Eternal Light!
How pure the soul must be
When, placed within Thy searching sight,
It shrinks not, but with calm delight
Can live and look on Thee.

The spirits that surround Thy throne
May bear the burning bliss;
But that is surely theirs alone,
Since they have never, never known
A fallen world like this.

Oh, how shall I, whose native sphere
Is dark, whose mind is dim,
Before th' Ineffable appear,
And on my natural spirit bear
The uncreated beam?

There is a way for man to rise
To Thee, sublime Abode;
And Offering and a Sacrifice,
A Holy Spirit's energies,
An Advocate with God:

These, these prepare us for the sight
Of holiness above;
The sons of ignorance and night
May dwell in the eternal Light,
Through the eternal Love.--------604
Unto the hills around do I lift up
My longing eyes;
O whence for me shall my salvation come,
From whence arise?
From God the Lord doth come my certain aid,
From God the Lord, who heaven and earth hath made.

He will not suffer that thy foot be moved:
Safe shalt thou be.
No careless slumber shall His eyelids close,
Who keepeth thee.
Behold, He sleepeth not, He slumbereth ne'er,
Who keepeth Israel in His holy care.

Jehovah is Himself thy keeper true,
Thy changeless shade;
Jehovah thy defense on thy right hand
Himself hath made.
And thee no sun by day shall ever smite;
No moon shall harm thee in the silent night.

From every evil shall He keep thy soul,
From every sin;
Jehovah shall preserve thy going out,
Thy coming in.
Above thee, watching, He whom we adore.
Shall keep thee henceforth, yea, for evermore.--------605
My home is God Himself; Christ brought me there,
And bade me dwell in Him, rejoicing there;
He bore me where no foot but His hath trod,
Within the holiest at home with God.
O holy place! O home divinely fair!
And we, God's little ones, abiding there.

A long, long road I traveled night and day,
And sought to find within myself some way,
Aught I could do, or feel to bring me near;
Self effort failed, and I was filled with fear,
And then I found Christ was the only way
That I must come to Him and in Him stay.

O wondrous place! O home divinely fair!
And I, God's little one, safe hidden there.
Lord, as I dwell in Thee and Thou in me,
So make me dead to everything but Thee;
That as I rest within my home most fair,
I'll share my God in all and everywhere.--------606
Oh, how the thought of God attracts
And draws the heart from earth,
And sickens it of passing shows
And dissipating mirth!

'Tis not enough to save our souls,
To shun th' eternal fires;
The thought of God will rouse the heart
To more sublime desires.

God only is the creature's home,
Though rough and straight the road;
Yet nothing less can satisfy
The love that longs for God.

Oh, utter but the Name of God
Down in your heart of hearts,
And see how from the world at once
All tempting light departs.

A trusting heart, a yearning eye,
Can win their way above;
If mountains can be moved by faith,
Is there less power in love?

How little of that road, my soul!
How little hast thou gone!
Take heart, and let the thought of God
Allure thee further on.

The freedom from all willful sin,
The Christian's daily task;
Oh! These are graces far below
What longing love would ask!

The perfect way is hard to flesh;
It is not hard to love;
If thou wert sick from want of God,
How swiftly wouldst thou move!

Then keep thy conscience sensitive;
No inward token miss:
And go where grace entices thee
Perfection lies in this.--------607
O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Our shelter from the stormy blast,
And our eternal home.

Under the shadow of Thy throne
Thy saints have dwelt secure;
Sufficient is Thine arm alone,
And our defence is sure.

Before the hills in order stood,
Or earth received her frame,
From everlasting Thou art God,
To endless years the same.

A thousand ages in Thy sight
Are like an evening gone;
Short as the watch that ends the night
Before the rising sun.

Time, like an ever-rolling stream,
Bears all its sons away;
They fly forgotten, as a dream
Dies at the opening day.

O God, our help in ages past,
Our hope for years to come,
Be Thou our guard while life shall last,
And our eternal home.--------608
What mystery, the Father, Son and Spirit,
In person three, in substance all are one.
How glorious, this God our being enters
To be our all, thru Spirit in the Son!

  The Triune God has now become our all!
  How wonderful! How glorious!
  This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
  How excellent! How marvelous!

How rich the source, the Father as the fountain,
And all this wealth He wants man to enjoy!
O blessed fact, this vast exhaustless portion
Is now for us forever to employ!

  The Triune God has now become our all!
  How wonderful! How glorious!
  This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
  How excellent! How marvelous!

How wonderful, the Son is God's expression
Come in the flesh to dwell with all mankind!
Redemption's work, how perfectly effective,
That sinners we with God might oneness find.

  The Triune God has now become our all!
  How wonderful! How glorious!
  This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
  How excellent! How marvelous!

The Spirit is the Son's transfiguration
Come into us as life the full supply.
Amazing fact, our spirit with the Spirit
Now mingles and in oneness joins thereby!

  The Triune God has now become our all!
  How wonderful! How glorious!
  This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
  How excellent! How marvelous!

How real it is that God is now the Spirit
For us to touch, experience day by day!
Astounding fact, with God we are one spirit,
And differ not in life in any way!

  The Triune God has now become our all!
  How wonderful! How glorious!
  This Gift divine we never can exhaust!
  How excellent! How marvelous!--------609
I praise Thee for Thy mystery,
That I may truly contact Thee;
In unapproachable light Thou wast
But now as Spirit nigh to me.

The Father, Son, and Spirit, Thou,
The triune God, my life fore'er;
In me Thou art the full supply
That I Thy holy nature share.

The triune God the Spirit is,
And comes as breath and wind to me;
'Tis thus I may experience
The Godhead's wondrous mystery.

All that the Father is and has
In His beloved Son doth rest,
And all the riches of the Son
Are by the Spirit now possessed.

The Spirit doth descend on me
And to my spirit enters in,
That He, the Father in the Son,
My blessed portion be within.

The Father is the fountainhead,
The Son expression gives to Him;
The Spirit is His very flow,
As my reality within.

The Father in the Son has come
That God to man Himself may show;
The Son as Spirit enters me
That God I inwardly may know.

The Father purposed that the Son
Should be the first in everything;
The Son the Father takes as Head
And over all His headship brings.

The Spirit perfectly desires
That Christ, the Son, be glorified,
And He reveals Him unto me,
That He be fully testified.

10 Thy final form the Spirit is,
Our worship to receive within;
If I Thy riches would enjoy,
In spirit I must contact Him.

11 If I in spirit worship Thee,
In spirit live, in spirit pray,
The Holy Spirit I will touch
And Thee enjoy in every way.--------610
God's Spirit His transmission is,
In Him God enters into us;
It is in Him that God in Christ
May be experienced by us.

God as the Father is the source,
And God the Son doth Him express;
God as the Spirit enters us,
That God as all we may possess.

The Father, who is veiled in light,
The Son to man hath fully shown;
The Spirit then transmitteth Him
That He may inwardly be known.

The Son within the Father is,
And now the Spirit is the Son.
The Spirit, Son, and Father God
Are now in us and with us one.

God as the Father in the Son
Has been embodied and expressed,
And God the Spirit is the Son's
Reality to be possessed.

May God the Father's love to us
In God the Son as grace be known,
Thru God the Spirit's fellowship,
That God our portion we may own.--------611
God's glorious substance Spirit is,
His essence, holy and divine;
To contact God and Him enjoy,
His Spirit I must touch with mine.

The spirit is the innermost,
The part of man most deep and real;
If he would contact God in life,
'Tis with the spirit he must deal.

The worship which the Father seeks
Is in the spirit's strength alone;
His Spirit into man's would come,
That His and man's may thus be one.

When Spirit unto spirit calls
The two commingle and are one;
Man's spirit is the Spirit's home,
The Spirit doth man's life become.

Man's spirit must God's Spirit touch
If in God's fulness he would live;
'Tis only with the spirit thus
That he to God may worship give.

In ministry and fellowship
Man to the spirit we must bring;
All ministry should turn to prayer,
Spirit to spirit answering.

In spirit we must pray and serve,
In spirit touch the life divine,
In spirit grow, in spirit build,
That Christ thru us may fully shine.

Lord, to the spirit I would turn
And learn to truly contact Thee;
Thy Spirit thus will flow with mine
And overflow eternally.--------612
God intends that all His being
Be my full supply;
With Him I must be united,
In spirit nigh.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.

All the riches of His nature
He has given me;
I must touch Him in the spirit,
These to see.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.

With the mind we understand Him,
With the spirit touch;
Those who never use the spirit
Lack very much.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.

When to messages I listen,
I must pray them in;
Thus the word will be digested
From within.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.

When the Word of God I study,
I must touch the Lord;
If in mind and not in spirit,
Dead is the Word.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.

O what riches, O what glory
In the Spirit shine!
When I exercise my spirit,
All are mine.

  All God's being, all His riches
  In the Spirit flow;
  I must exercise my spirit
  Him to know.--------613
  Repeat the last line of each verse

I would commune with Thee, my God;
E'en to Thy seat I come;
I leave my joys, I leave my sins,
And seek in Thee my home.

I stand upon the mount of God,
With sunlight in my soul;
I see the storms in vales beneath,
I hear the thunder's roll.

But I am calm with Thee, my God,
Beneath these glorious skies;
And to the height on which I stand
Nor storms nor clouds can rise.

Oh, this is life! Oh, this is joy,
My God, to find Thee so;
Thy face to see, Thy voice to hear,
And all Thy love to know.--------614
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee;
E'en though it be a cross
That raiseth me,
Still all my song shall be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Though, like a wanderer,
The sun gone down,
Darkness comes over me,
My rest a stone;
Yet in my dreams I'd be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

There let me see the sight,
An open heaven;
All that Thou sendest me,
In mercy given;
Angels to beckon me
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.

Then, with my waking thoughts
Bright with Thy praise,
Out of my stony griefs
Bethel I'll raise,
So by my woes to be
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer, my God, to Thee,
Nearer to Thee.--------615
Begin the day with God!
He is thy Sun and Day!
His is the radiance of thy dawn;
To Him address thy lay.

Sing a new song at morn!
Join the glad woods and hills;
Join the fresh winds and seas and plains,
Join the bright flowers and rills.

Sing thy first song to God!
Not to thy fellow men;
Not to the creatures of His hand,
But to the glorious One.

Take thy first walk with God!
Let Him go forth with thee;
By stream, or sea, or mountain path,
Seek still His company.

Thy first transaction be
With God Himself above;
So shall thy business prosper well
And all the day be love.--------616
Day is dying in the west,
Heav'n is touching earth with rest,
Wait and worship while the night
Sets her evening lamps alight
Through all the sky.

  Holy, holy, holy,
  Lord God of Hosts!
  Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
  Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
  O Lord, most high!

Lord of life, beneath the dome
Of the universe, Thy home,
Gather us, who seek Thy face,
To fold of Thy embrace,
For Thou art nigh.

  Holy, holy, holy,
  Lord God of Hosts!
  Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
  Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
  O Lord, most high!

While the deepening shadows fall,
Heart of love, enfolding all,
Through the glory and the grace
Of the stars that veil Thy face,
Our hearts ascend.

  Holy, holy, holy,
  Lord God of Hosts!
  Heav'n and earth are full of Thee!
  Heav'n and earth are praising Thee,
  O Lord, most high!--------617
Thou sweet, beloved will of God,
My anchor ground, my fortress hill,
My spirit's silent, fair abode,
In Thee I hide me and am still.

O Will, that willest good alone,
Lead Thou the way, Thou guidest best;
A little child, I follow on,
And, trusting, lean upon Thy breast.

God's will doth make the bitter sweet,
And all is well when it is done;
Unless His will doth hallow it,
The glory of all joy is gone.

Thy beautiful sweet will, my God,
Hold fast in its sublime embrace
My captive will, a gladsome bird,
Prisoned in such a realm of grace.

Within this place of certain good
Love evermore expands her wings,
Or nestling in Thy perfect choice,
Abides content with what it brings.

Oh, lightest burden, sweetest yoke;
It lifts, it bears my happy soul,
It giveth wings to this poor heart;
My freedom is Thy grand control.

Upon God's will I lay me down,
As child upon its mother's breast;
No silken couch, nor softest bed,
Could ever give me such deep rest.

Thy wonderful grand will, my God,
With triumph now I make it mine;
And faith shall cry a joyous Yes
To every dear command of Thine.--------618
On a hill far away stood an old rugged cross,
The emblem of suff'ring and shame,
And I love that old cross where the Dearest and Best
For a world of lost sinners was slain.

  So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
  Till my trophies at last I lay down;
  I will cling to the old rugged cross,
  And exchange it some day for a crown.

Oh, that old rugged cross, so despised by the world,
Has a wondrous attraction for me;
For the dear Lamb of God left His glory above,
To bear it to dark Calvary.

  So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
  Till my trophies at last I lay down;
  I will cling to the old rugged cross,
  And exchange it some day for a crown.

In the old rugged cross, stained with blood so divine,
A wondrous beauty I see;
For 'twas on that old cross Jesus suffered and died,
To pardon and sanctify me.

  So I'll cherish the old rugged cross,
  Till my trophies at last I lay down;
  I will cling to the old rugged cross,
  And exchange it some day for a crown.--------619
In the cross of Christ I glory,
Tow'ring o'er the wrecks of time;
All the light of sacred story
Gather round its head sublime.

When the woes of life o'ertake me,
Hopes deceive, and fears annoy,
Never shall the cross forsake me,
Lo! It glows with peace and joy.

When the sun of bliss is beaming
Light and love upon my way,
From the cross the radiance streaming
Adds more luster to the day.

Bane and blessing, pain and pleasure,
By the cross are sanctified;
Peace is there that knows no measure,
Joys that through all time abide.--------620
The cross it standeth fast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Defying every blast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
The winds of hell have blown,
The world its hate hath shown,
Yet it is not overthrown,
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah for the cross;
  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  It shall never suffer loss.

It is the old cross still,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Its triumph let us tell,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
The grace of God here shone,
Through Christ the blessed Son,
Who hath redemption won,
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah for the cross;
  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  It shall never suffer loss.

'Twas here the debt was paid,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Our sins on Jesus laid,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
So round the cross we sing
Of Christ, our offering,
Of Christ, our offering,
Of Christ, our living King,
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Hallelujah for the cross;
  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  It shall never suffer loss.--------621
Beneath the cross of Jesus
I fain would take my stand,
The shadow of a mighty Rock
Within a weary land;
A home within the wilderness,
A rest upon the way,
From the burning of the noontide heat,
And the burden of the day.

Oh, safe and happy shelter!
Oh, refuge tried and sweet!
Oh, trysting place where heaven's love
And heaven's justice meet.
As to the holy patriarch
That wondrous dream was given,
So is my Savior by the cross
A ladder up to heaven.

There lies beneath its shadow,
But on the farther side,
The darkness of an awful grave
That gapes both deep and wide;
And there between us stands the cross,
Two arms outstretched to save,
Like a watchman set to guard the way
From that eternal grave.

Upon that cross of Jesus
Mine eyes at times can see
The very dying form of One,
Who suffered there for me;
And from my smitten heart, with tears,
Two wonders I confess,
The wonders of His glorious love,
And my own worthlessness.

I take, O cross, thy shadow
For my abiding place;
I ask no other sunshine than
The sunshine of His face;
Content to let the world go by,
To know no gain nor loss,
My sinful self my only shame,
My glory all the cross.--------622
If we take the cross, will we but suffer pain?
Nay, if we bear the cross, be sure that we will die!
The meaning of the cross is that we may be slain;
The cross experienced the self will crucify.

Divine deliverance e'er slays man by the cross;
Though cruel it may seem, it is a grand release.
Christ ne'er will be our life if we escape the cross;
Christ ne'er will be expressed but by our sure decease.

The cross's final goal, that God's will be fulfilled;
His will's arch enemy is but the self of man.
If self be done away and all the soul-life killed,
God's will shall then prevail and prospered be His plan.--------623
There is no gain but by a loss;
We cannot save but by the cross,
The corn of wheat to multiply
Must fall into the ground and die;
O should a soul alone remain
When it a hundredfold can gain?
O should a soul alone remain
When it a hundredfold can gain?

Our souls are held by all they hold;
Slaves still are slaves in chains of gold;
To whatsoever we may cling,
We make it a soul-chaining thing.
Whether it be a life or land,
And dear as our right eye or hand.
Whether it be a life or land,
And dear as our right eye or hand.

Wherever you ripe fields behold,
Waving to God their sheaves of gold,
Be sure some corn of wheat has died,
Some saintly soul been crucified;
Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
And fought hell's legions undismayed.
Someone has suffered, wept and prayed,
And fought hell's legions undismayed.--------624
The heavier the cross, the nearer God;
No cross without, no God within!
The prince of darkness thus is trod,
Amid the world's false glare and din.
Oh, happy he, with all his loss,
Whom God hath set beneath the cross.

The heavier the cross, the better saint;
This is the touchstone God applies.
The gardens many would be faint,
Unwet by showers from weeping eyes!
The gold by fire is purified;
The saint is by much trouble tried.

The heavier the cross, the stronger faith:
The loaded palm strikes deeper root;
The vine juice sweetly issueth
When men have pressed the clustered fruit;
And courage grows where dangers come,
Like pearls beneath the salty foam.

The heavier the cross, the deeper prayer;
The bruisd herbs most fragrant are.
If sky and wind were always fair,
The sailor would not watch the star;
And David's Psalms had ne'er been sung
If grief his heart had never wrung.

The heavier the cross, the more inspired;
From vales to climb to mountain crest;
The pilgrim, of the desert tired,
Longs for the Canaan of his rest.
The dove has here no rest in sight,
And to the ark she wings her flight.

The heavier the cross, the easier to die;
Death is a kinder face to see;
Our life's decay we dare defy,
From life's distress we then are free.
The cross sublimely lifts our faith
To Him who triumphed over death.

Thou Crucified! The cross I bear.
The longer, may it dearer be;
And lest I faint while ling'ring here,
Implant Thou such a heart in me
That faith and love may flourish e'er,
Till for the cross the crown I wear.--------625
'Tis my happiness below
Not to live without the cross;
But the Savior's pow'r to know
Sanctifying every loss.

Trail must and will befall;
But with humble faith to see
Love inscribed upon them all
This is happiness to me.

Did I meet no trials here,
No chastisement by the way,
Might I not with reason fear
I should prove a castaway?

Trails make the promise sweet;
Trials give new life to prayer;
Bring me to my Savior's feet,
Lay me low and keep me there.--------626
Olives that have known no pressure
No oil can bestow;
If the grapes escape the winepress,
Cheering wine can never flow;
Spikenard only through the crushing,
Fragrance can diffuse.
Shall I then, Lord, shrink from suff'ring
Which Thy love for me would choose?

  Each blow I suffer
  Is true gain to me.
  In the place of what Thou takest
  Thou dost give Thyself to me.

Do my heartstrings need Thy stretching,
Songs divine to prove?
Do I need for sweetest music
Cruel treatment of Thy love?
Lord, I fear no deprivation
If it draws to Thee;
I would yield in full surrender
All Thy heart of love to see.

  Each blow I suffer
  Is true gain to me.
  In the place of what Thou takest
  Thou dost give Thyself to me.

I'm ashamed, my Lord, for seeking
Self to guard alway;
Though Thy love has done its stripping,
Yet I've been compelled this way.
Lord, according to Thy pleasure
Fully work on me;
Heeding not my human feelings,
Only do what pleases Thee.

  Each blow I suffer
  Is true gain to me.
  In the place of what Thou takest
  Thou dost give Thyself to me.

If Thy mind and mine should differ,
Still pursue Thy way;
If Thy pleasure means my sorrow,
Still my heart shall answer, "Yea!"
'Tis my deep desire to please Thee,
Though I suffer loss;
E'en though Thy delight and glory
Mean that I endure the cross.

  Each blow I suffer
  Is true gain to me.
  In the place of what Thou takest
  Thou dost give Thyself to me.

Oh, I'll praise Thee, e'en if weeping
Mingle with my song.
Thine increasing sweetness calls forth
Grateful praises all day long.
Thou hast made Thyself more precious
Than all else to me:
Thou increase and I decrease, Lord
This is now my only plea.

  Each blow I suffer
  Is true gain to me.
  In the place of what Thou takest
  Thou dost give Thyself to me.--------627
Lord, day by day I view Thy wondrous Cross
On Calvary!
And day by day I stretch my hands thereon
And die with Thee.

I "glory in the Cross" most loving Lord,
Because I know
It is the power to save and satisfy,
Where'er I go.

The daily Cross becomes the deepest joy,
For just beyond
The Cross, I clearly see how Cross and Crown
Do correspond.

Oh, gracious Lord, how sweet to take from Thee
The daily Cross!
And know that I can never separate
Its gain and loss.

The daily Cross is daily loss to all
That keeps from Thee;
The daily Cross is daily gain of all
Thou art for me.--------628
Via Bethlehem we journey,
We whose hearts on God are set;
Babe-like souls of Jesus learning,
While our cheeks with tears are wet;
For the manger and the stable
Are not pleasant to our eyes,
But our feet must follow Jesus,
If our hands would grasp the prize.

Via Nazareth! The pathway
Narrows still as on we go,
Years of toil none understanding,
Yet God teaches us to know
That the servant is not greater
Than the Lord, who through long years
Hid Himself from this world's glory,
Follow Him! Count not the tears.

Via Galilee, we see Him!
Stones are hurled, and cursed hissed
By the men who gather round Him,
Has He not the pathway missed?
No! Unharmed the Savior passes,
And this rough bit of the way
We must travel, since like Jesus,
Nothing can our purpose stay.

Via too, the awful anguish
Of the hours beneath the trees,
Where the host of Satan linger,
Awful hours of anguish these!
Yet we fail not, for God's angels
Minister to us, and say,
"Look, beloved, at the glory,
Conflict is but for a day!"

Then the Cross! For via Calvary
Every royal soul must go;
Here we draw the veil, for Jesus
Only can the pathway show;
"If we suffer with Him," listen,
Just a little, little while,
And the memory will have faded
In the glory of His smile!

Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,
Knowing that all life has fled;
(Fellow-pilgrims, art thou numbered
With the men the world calls dead?)
Thence we rise, and live with Jesus,
Throned above the world's mad strife,
Gladly forfeiting forever,
All that worldlings count as life.

On we press! And yonder gleaming,
Nearer every day, we see
The great walls of that fair city,
God has built for such as we;
And we catch the tender music
Of the choirs that sing of One
Who once died to have us with Him
In His kingdom, on the throne.

Just a few more miles, beloved!
And our feet shall ache no more;
No more sin, and no more sorrow,
Hush thee, Jesus went before;
And I hear Him sweetly whispering,
"Faint not, fear not, still press on,
For it may be ere tomorrow,
The long journey will be done."--------629
Hast thou no scar?
No hidden scar on foot, or side, or hand?
I hear thee sung throughout the land,
I hear them hail thy shining star,
Hast thou no scar? No scar?

Hast thou no wound?
Yet I was wounded by the archers, spent,
Leaned Me against a tree; and rent
By ravening beasts 'round Me, I swooned:
Hast thou no wound? No wound?

No wound? No scar?
Yet, as the Master shall the servant be,
And pierced the feet that follow Me;
But whole? Can he have followed far
Who has no wound nor scar?--------630
The way of the Cross means sacrifice,
As to God you yield your all
To be laid on the altar, the place of death,
Where fire will surely fall.

'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
To God are you wholly true?

As the voice of song and prayer we raise,
How easy to say, We give all;
Till some rougher cross lies just before,
And sterner is duty's call.

'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
To God are you wholly true?

Do you falter then, or, true to death,
Just die on the cross in the way,
Till the fulness of life from the Living One
Is filling you day by day?

'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
To God are you wholly true?

'Tis the plan of life, for you die to live,
One with Jesus crucified;
With the life alone to be lived through you,
Of the Risen, the Glorified.

'Tis the way of the Cross, are you willing for this?
What does bearing the Cross mean to you?
You who've given yourself, your all to God!
To God are you wholly true?--------631
If I'd know Christ's risen power,
I must ever love the Cross;
Life from death alone arises;
There's no gain except by loss.

  If no death, no life,
  If no death, no life;
  Life from death alone arises;
  If no death, no life.

If I'd have Christ formed within me,
I must breathe my final breath,
Live within the Cross's shadow,
Put my soul-life e'er to death.

  If no death, no life,
  If no death, no life;
  Life from death alone arises;
  If no death, no life.

If God thru th' Eternal Spirit
Nail me ever with the Lord;
Only then as death is working
Will His life thru me be poured.

  If no death, no life,
  If no death, no life;
  Life from death alone arises;
  If no death, no life.--------632
Never further than Thy Cross,
Never higher than Thy feet,
Here earth's precious things seem dross,
Here earth's bitter things grow sweet.

Gazing thus our sin we see,
Learn Thy love while gazing thus;
Sin which laid the Cross on Thee;
Love which bore the Cross for us.

Here we learn to serve and give,
And rejoicing, self deny;
Here we gather love to live;
Here we gather faith to die.

Symbols of our liberty
And our service here unite;
Captives, by Thy Cross set free;
Soldiers of Thy Cross, we fight.

Pressing onwards as we can,
Still to this our hearts must tend;
Where our earliest hopes began,
There our last aspirings end.

Till amid the host of light
We in Thee redeemed, complete,
Through Thy Cross made pure and white,
Cast our crowns before Thy feet.--------633
And wouldst thou live on earth as "more than conqu'ror"?
Victorious o'er the worldly life around?
Mark well the pathway that thy Lord hath trodden,
Since here alone the secret can be found.

He died, and by His death He dealt the death-blow
To sin and Satan's power for evermore,
And they, who die with Him, shall rise victorious,
And "in this sign" shall triumph more and more.

The Cross henceforth their mark of perfect freedom,
What can they lose, who have surrendered all?
What can they fear, who have no reputation?
What shall they shrink from, when His voice doth call?

"In this sign," therefore, go henceforth and conquer,
Finding the place of death the gate of life,
"Life more abundant," life in all its fulness,
In the deep calm of God, set free from strife.--------634
Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
Through the holy war;
In this sign we conquer
Now and evermore.
Not of man the power,
Not to man the fame;
We are victors only
In our Leader's name.

  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
  Through the holy war;
  In this sign we conquer
  Now and evermore.

Not with pomp and pageant,
Not in earthly pride;
We must fight our battles
Like the Crucified.
Overcome by suff'ring,
Conquer through defeat;
Tried and tested daily
In the furnace heat.

  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
  Through the holy war;
  In this sign we conquer
  Now and evermore.

Kind, yet we are fighting,
Bold, yet humbly meek;
Resting while we're working,
Strong, but ever weak.
Timid, though courageous,
Gaining as we give;
Crucified with Jesus,
Yet, in Him, we live.

  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
  Through the holy war;
  In this sign we conquer
  Now and evermore.

By a cloud encompassed,
Witnesses to prove,
Saints, apostles, prophets,
Precious ones we love;
While "advance!" is sounding,
Mounts the battle thrill.
Cross of Christ! Lead onward
Where the Captain will.

  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
  Through the holy war;
  In this sign we conquer
  Now and evermore.

Marching in the pathway
That the Master trod,
Walks One daily with us
Like the Son of God.
To the end enduring,
Armor ne'er laid down,
Till the Cross leads upward
To the blood-bought crown.

  Cross of Christ! Lead onward,
  Through the holy war;
  In this sign we conquer
  Now and evermore.--------635
Let us contemplate the grape vine,
From its life now let us learn,
How its growth is fraught with suff'ring,
Midst environment so stern;
How unlike the untamed flowers
Growing in the wilderness
In a maze of wild confusion,
Making patterns numberless.

But the blossoms of the grape vine
Without glory are and small;
Though they do have some expression,
They are hardly seen withal.
But a day since they have flowered
Into fruit the blooms have grown;
Never may they wave corollas
With luxuriant beauty shown.

To a post the vine is fastened;
Thus it cannot freely grow;
When its branches are extended,
To the trellis tied they go.
To the stony soil committed,
Drawing thence its food supply;
It can never choose its own way,
Or from difficulty fly.

Oh, how beautiful its verdure,
Which in spring spread o'er the field.
From life's energy and fulness
Growth abundant doth it yield.
Till it's full of tender branches
Twining freely everywhere,
Stretching 'gainst the sky's deep azure
Tasting sweetly of the air.

But the master of the vineyard
Not in lenience doth abide,
But with knife and pruning scissors
Then would strip it of its pride.
Caring not the vine is tender,
But with deep, precision stroke
All the pretty, excess branches
From the vine are neatly broke.

In this time of loss and ruin,
Dare the vine self-pity show?
Nay, it gives itself more fully
To the one who wounds it so,
To the hand that strips its branches,
Till of beauty destitute,
That its life may not be wasted,
But preserved for bearing fruit.

Into hard wood slowly hardens
Every stump of bleeding shoot,
Each remaining branch becoming
Clusters of abundant fruit.
Then, beneath the scorching sunshine,
Leaves are dried and from it drop;
Thus the fruit more richly ripens
Till the harvest of the crop.

Bowed beneath its fruitful burden,
Loaded branches are brought low
Labor of its growth thru suff'ring
Many a purposed, cutting blow.
Now its fruit is fully ripened,
Comforted the vine would be;
But the harvest soon is coming,
And its days of comfort flee.

Hands will pick and feet will trample
All the riches of the vine,
Till from out the reddened wine-press
Flows a river full of wine.
All the day its flow continues,
Bloody-red, without alloy,
Gushing freely, richly, sweetly,
Filling all the earth with joy.

10 In appearance now the grape vine
Barren is and pitiful;
Having given all, it enters
Into night inscrutable.
No one offers to repay it
For the cheering wine that's drunk,
But 'tis stripped and cut e'en further
To a bare and branchless trunk

11 Yet its wine throughout the winter
Warmth and sweetness ever bears
Unto those in coldness shiv'ring,
Pressed with sorrow, pain, and cares.
Yet without, alone, the grape vine
Midst the ice and snow doth stand,
Steadfastly its lot enduring,
Though 'tis hard to understand.

12 Winter o'er, the vine prepareth
Fruit again itself to bear;
Budding forth and growing branches,
Beauteous green again to wear;
Never murmuring or complaining
For the winter's sore abuse,
Or for all its loss desiring
Its fresh off'ring to reduce.

13 Breathing air, untainted, heavenly,
As it lifts its arms on high,
Earth's impure, defiled affections
Ne'er the vine may occupy.
Facing sacrifice, yet smiling,
And while love doth prune once more,
Strokes it bears as if it never
Suffered loss and pain before.

14 From the branches of the grape vine
Sap and blood and wine doth flow.
Does the vine, for all it suffered,
Lost, and yielded, poorer grow?
Drunkards of the earth and wanderers,
From it drink and merry make,
From their pleasure and enjoyment
Do they richer thereby wake?

15 Not by gain our life is measured,
But by what we've lost 'tis scored;
'Tis not how much wine is drunken,
But how much has been outpoured.
For the strength of love e'er standeth
In the sacrifice we bear;
He who has the greatest suff'ring
Ever has the most to share.

16 He who treats himself severely
Is the best for God to gain;
He who hurts himself most dearly
Most can comfort those in pain.
He who suffering never beareth
Is but empty "sounding brass";
He who self-like never spareth
Has the joys which all surpass.--------636
"If it die," oh, hear the message
Falling from thy Lord,
"If it die," much fruit it beareth,
'Tis thy Savior's word.

Would'st thou see life work in others,
Thou thyself must die.
Fall into the ground, be buried,
Low in darkness lie.

But He leaves thee not in darkness,
Light shall greet thine eyes,
And in glad new life and glory
He shall bid thee rise.

Dost thou crave to tread the pathway
And His life to share?
As thou passeth thru death's gateway
He will meet thee there.

Thou shalt learn the blessed secret,
He shall live that dies;
From the life poured out in secret
Shall a harvest rise.--------637
"Wrecked outright on Jesus' breast":
Only "wrecked" souls thus can sing;
Little boats that hug the shore,
Fearing what the storm may bring,
Never find on Jesus' breast,
All that "wrecked" souls mean by rest.

"Wrecked outright!" So we lament;
But when storms have done their worst,
Then the soul, surviving all,
In Eternal arms is nursed;
There to find that nought can move
One, embosomed in such love.

"Wrecked outright!" No more to own
E'en a craft to sail the sea;
Still a voyager, yet now
Anchored to Infinity;
Nothing left to do but fling
Care aside, and simply cling.

"Wrecked outright!" 'Twas purest gain,
Henceforth other craft can see
That the storm may be a boon,
That, however rough the sea,
God Himself doth watchful stand,
For the "wreck' is in His hand.--------638
To Calv'ry let our eyes be turned,
With Calv'ry love our hearts be burned;
For there in Calv'ry's awful hour,
Love conquered sin and Satan's pow'r.

Lord, turn our gaze upon Thy Cross,
Counting all else not gain but loss;
For this we pray, this is our plea
Lord, keep our eyes on Calvary.--------639
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
The life of God eternal manifest;
'Tis uncreated, indestructible,
'Tis Christ Himself, unconqu'rable, expressed.

Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
Though all its force against it may combine;
Death only gives it opportunity
To show the boundless pow'r of life divine.

Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
The more interred, the more it multiplies;
All kinds of suff'ring only help it grow
And fruits of life abundant realize.

Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
Thru every block and barrier it breaks;
Conqu'ring the pow'r of darkness and of hell,
It swallows death and victory partakes.

Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
All of God's fulness it will manifest;
God's righteousness and holiness it yields,
His glorious image by it is expressed.

Oh, may I know this resurrection life,
In every kind of death its pow'r outpoured,
In my experience ever realize
This life is nought but Christ my living Lord.--------640
Life out of death  dear Master, is it spoken
Of the life here, or in the better land?
Nay, wherefore wait? The vessel marred and broken,
Shall now be molded by the Potter's hand.

Life out of death  oh, wondrous resurrection!
Seed sown in conscious weakness, raised in power;
Thy life lived out in days of toil and friction,
"Not I, but Christ" in me from hour to hour.

Life out of death  a pilgrim path and lonely,
Trodden by those who glory in the Cross.
They live in fellowship with "Jesus only,"
And for His sake count earthly gain but loss.

Life out of death  blest mission to be ever
Bearing the living water brimming o'er.
With life abundant from the clear, pure river,
Telling that thirsty souls need thirst no more.--------641
Art thou hung'ring for the fulness
Of the blessing Christ doth give?
Longing now to learn the secret
Of the life He bids thee live?
In His word thine answer standeth,
"Christ who is our Life" it saith;
Open now thy heart, and trust Him,
There to dwell, henceforth, by faith.

Christ, the Lord's Anointed, reigning
O'er the life He died to win,
Daily shall reveal more fully
His great power, without, within.
What thou never could'st accomplish
Shall His Spirit work through thee,
While thy soul this witness beareth,
'Tis not I, but Christ in me.

In Him dwelleth all God's fulness,
In Him thou art made complete;
Rise, and claim thy heavenly birthright,
Kneeling at thy Father's feet.
He will never disappoint thee,
Praise Him that the gift is thine;
Then go forth to live each moment
On sufficiency divine.

Lord, I come, and simply resting
On Thy faithful, changeless word,
I believe the blood doth cleanse me,
And that Christ is crownd Lord.
Grant henceforth a ceaseless outflow
Of Thy life and love through me;
Reaching those who sit in darkness,
Winning priceless souls to Thee.--------642
"Within the Veil": be this, belov'd, thy portion,
Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell;
Beholding Him, until thy face His glory,
Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.

"Within the Veil," for only as thou gazest
Upon the matchless beauty of His face,
Canst thou become a living revelation
Of His great heart of love, His untold grace.

"Within the Veil," His fragrance poured upon thee,
Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;
"Within the Veil," His hand shall tune the music
Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord.

"Within the Veil," thy spirit deeply anchored,
Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;
"Within the Veil," thy soul with Him united,
Shall live on earth His resurrection life.--------643
Take time to behold Him,
Speak oft with Thy Lord,
Abide in Him always,
And feed on His Word.
Wait thou in His presence,
Submissive and meek,
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek.

Take time to behold Him,
The world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus
Like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends, in thy conduct,
His likeness shall see.

Take time to behold Him,
Let Him be thy guide;
And run not before Him
Whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow
Still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.

Take time to behold Him,
Be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each temper
Beneath His control.
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou then shalt be fitted
His mercy to prove.--------644
Looking unto Jesus,
Never need we yield!
Over all the armor,
Faith the battle-shield!
Standard of salvation,
In our hearts unfurled,
Let its elevation
Overcome the world.

  Looking unto Jesus,
  Never need we yield!
  Over all the armor,
  Faith the battle-shield!

Look away to Jesus,
Look away from all!
Then we need not stumble,
Then we shall not fall.
From each snare that lureth,
Foe or phantom grim,
Safety this ensureth,
Look away to Him.

  Looking unto Jesus,
  Never need we yield!
  Over all the armor,
  Faith the battle-shield!

Looking into Jesus,
Wond'ringly we trace
Heights of power and glory,
Depths of love and grace.
Vistas far unfolding
Ever stretch before,
As we gaze, beholding,
Ever more and more.

  Looking unto Jesus,
  Never need we yield!
  Over all the armor,
  Faith the battle-shield!

Looking up to Jesus
On the emerald throne,
Faith shall pierce the heavens,
Where our King is gone.
Lord, on Thee depending,
Now, continually,
Heart and mind ascending,
Let us dwell with Thee.

  Looking unto Jesus,
  Never need we yield!
  Over all the armor,
  Faith the battle-shield!--------645
O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There's light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free.

  Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
  Look full in His wonderful face,
  And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
  In the light of His glory and grace.

Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
O'er us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conqu'rors we are!

  Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
  Look full in His wonderful face,
  And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
  In the light of His glory and grace.

His Word shall not fail you, He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!

  Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
  Look full in His wonderful face,
  And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
  In the light of His glory and grace.--------646
Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When conscious of thy sin,
Its heavy weight upon thee,
Its mighty pow'r within:
Then is the hour for pleading
His finished work for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
His blood was shed for me.

Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When tempted to transgress,
By word or look of anger,
Or thought of bitterness:
Then is the hour for claiming
Thy Lord to fight for thee:
Then is the time for singing,
He doth deliver me.

Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When daily cares perplex,
And trifles seem so mighty
Thy inner soul to vex:
Then is the hour for grasping
His hand who walked the sea:
Then is the time for singing,
He makes it calm for me.

Oh, trust thyself to Jesus
When thou art wearied sore,
When head or hand refuses
To think or labor more:
Then is the hour for leaning
Upon the Master's breast:
Then is the time for singing,
My Savior gives me rest.--------647
Trust Him when thy wants are many;
Trust Him when thy friends are few;
And the time of swift temptation
Is the time to trust Him too.

Trust Him when thy soul is burdened
With the sense of all its sin;
He will speak the word of pardon,
He will make thee clean within.

Trust Him for the grace sufficient,
Ever equal to thy need;
Trust Him always for the answer,
When in His dear name you plead.

Trust Him for the grace to conquer,
He is able to subdue;
Trust Him for the power for service;
Trust Him for the blessing too.

Trust Him when dark doubts assail thee,
Trust Him when thy strength is small,
Trust Him when to simply trust Him
Seems the hardest thing of all.

Trust Him; His is ever faithful;
Trust Him, for His will is best;
Trust Him, for the heart of Jesus
Is the only place of rest.

Trust Him, then, through cloud or sunshine,
All the cares upon Him cast,
Till the storm of life is over,
And the trusting days are past.--------648
Soldier, soldier, fighting in the world's great strife,
On thyself relying, battling for thy life;
Trust thyself no longer,
Trust to Christ  He's stronger;
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

In your daily duty, standing up for right,
Are you sometimes weary  heart not always light?
Doubt your Savior never,
This your motto ever:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

If your way be weary He will help you through
Help you in your troubles and your pleasures too;
Say, when Satan's by you;
Say, when all things try you:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

In a world of trouble, tempted oft to stray,
You need never stumble, Satan cannot stay,
Will but tempt you vainly,
If you tell him plainly:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.

Jesus' power is boundless, boundless as the sea;
He is always able, able to keep me,
Power bring from my weakness,
Glory from my meekness:
I can all things, all things do
Through Christ, which strengtheneth me.--------649
Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne,
From death into life He went for His own;
All power in earth, all power above,
Is given to Him for the flock of His love.

  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe;
  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe.

Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead,
Your Shepherd selecteth the path you must tread;
The waters of Marah He'll sweeten for thee,
He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane.

  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe;
  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe.

Fear not, little flock, whatever your lot,
He enters all rooms, "the doors being shut";
He never forsakes, He never is gone,
So count on His presence in darkness and dawn.

  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe;
  Only believe, only believe;
  All things are possible, only believe.--------650
O doubting, struggling Christian,
Why thus in anguish pray?
O cease to doubt and struggle,
There is a better way.

  O settle it all with Jesus,
  O settle it all today;
  O cease to doubt and struggle,
  O cease to plead and pray;
  O rest in His word forever,
  And settle it all today.

Give up thy will to Jesus,
And trust Him though He slay;
Hush all thy fears and questions,
And settle it today.

  O settle it all with Jesus,
  O settle it all today;
  O cease to doubt and struggle,
  O cease to plead and pray;
  O rest in His word forever,
  And settle it all today.

O soul so tossed with tempest,
Upon His promise stay;
Cast out faith's strong sheet anchor,
And settle it today.

  O settle it all with Jesus,
  O settle it all today;
  O cease to doubt and struggle,
  O cease to plead and pray;
  O rest in His word forever,
  And settle it all today.

Lord, I give up the struggle,
To Thee commit my way;
I trust Thy word forever,
And settle it today.

  O settle it all with Jesus,
  O settle it all today;
  O cease to doubt and struggle,
  O cease to plead and pray;
  O rest in His word forever,
  And settle it all today.--------651
When is the time to trust?
Is it when all is calm,
When waves the victor's palm,
And life is one glad psalm?
Nay! But the time to trust
Is when the waves beat high,
When storm clouds fill the sky,
And pray'r is one long cry.

When is the time to trust?
Is it when friends are true?
Is it when comforts woo
In all we say and do?
Nay! But the time to trust
Is when we stand alone,
And summer birds are flown,
And every prop is gone.

When is the time to trust?
Is it some future day,
When you have tried your way,
And learned to trust and pray?
Nay! But the time to trust
Is in this moment's need,
Poor, broken, bruisd reed,
Poor, troubled soul, make speed!

When is the time to trust?
Is it when hopes beat high,
When sunshine gilds the sky
With joy and ecstasy?
Nay! But the time to trust
Is when our joy has fled,
When sorrow bows the head,
And all is cold and dead.--------652
O troubled soul, beneath the rod
Thy Father speaks  be still, be still;
Learn to be silent unto God,
And let Him mold thee to His will.

  Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
  Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
  Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
  Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.

O anxious soul, lay down thy load,
Oh, hear His voice, He speaks to thee,
"Be still and know that I am God,
And cast thy every care on Me."

  Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
  Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
  Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
  Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.

O fearful soul, be still, be still,
Be of good cheer; has He not said,
"I will be with you, fear no ill,
'Tis I, 'tis I, be not afraid"?

  Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
  Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
  Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
  Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.

O praying soul, be still, be still,
He cannot break His plighted word;
Sink down into His blessed will,
And wait in patience on the Lord.

  Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
  Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
  Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
  Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.

O waiting soul, be still, be strong,
And though He tarry, trust and wait;
Doubt not, He will not wait too long,
Fear not, He will not come too late.

  Be still, O troubled soul, be still;
  Fear not, thy Father's arms enfold thee.
  Take up thy cross, lay down thy will;
  Be silent unto God, and let Him mold thee.--------653
Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
Let toil and anguish cease;
Take from Thy Savior's hands
Thine heritage of peace.

Lie low before His feet,
Too low thou canst not be,
For sacred calm is here,
And here is liberty.

Submit, lay down thine arms,
Nor question, nor rebel;
So shalt thou hear erewhile
His whisper, It is well.

No secret wound of thine,
Though it be great or small,
Presume to hide from Him;
Confess, confess it all;

Nor merit of thine own
Upon His altar place;
All is of Christ alone,
And of His perfect grace.

Rest, rest thee, weary heart,
Let care and anguish cease;
Take from thy Savior's hands
Thine heritage of peace.--------654
"Be all at rest, my soul!" Oh! Blessed secret
Of the true life that glorifies thy Lord;
Not always doth the busiest soul best serve Him,
But he who resteth on His faithful word.

"Be all at rest!" for rest is highest service;
To the still heart God doth His secrets tell;
Thus shalt thou learn to wait, and watch, and labor,
Strengthened to bear, since Christ in thee doth dwell.

"Be all at rest!" for rest alone becometh
The soul that casts on Him its every care;
"Be all at rest!" so shall thy life proclaim Him
A God who worketh and who heareth prayer.

"Be all at rest!" so shalt thou be an answer
To those who question, "Who is God, and where?"
For God is rest, and where He dwells is stillness,
And they who dwell in Him that rest shall share.--------655
Feed on His faithfulness, my soul,
Who chose thee for His own,
Who bears thy name in Love's pure flame
Before the heav'nly throne;
Lay at His feet thy fear,
Thy burdens, thy distress,
Prostrate embrace thy Fount of Grace
Feed on His faithfulness.

Feed on His faithfulness, my soul,
Who suffered Calvary,
Who Victor rose o'er all thy foes,
Who lives, who prays, for thee!
Not thine the battle is,
Though close the conflict press;
'Tis His alone who wears the crown
Feed on His faithfulness.

Feed on His faithfulness, my soul,
Then naught shall thee affright;
His perfect will all fear shall still,
His wisdom guide aright.
He slumbers not nor sleeps,
But waits His saints to bless;
Th' eternal Throne is His alone
Feed on His faithfulness.

Feed on His faithfulness, my soul;
So shalt thou see His face,
Transforming thee till all shall see
The glory of His grace;
Closer to His great heart
In glad abandon press;
Fling thy soul down upon His own
Feed on His faithfulness.--------656
"Consider Him," let Christ thy pattern be,
And know that He hath apprehended thee
To share His very life, His pow'r divine,
And in the likeness of thy Lord to shine.

"Consider Him"; so shalt thou, day by day,
Seek out the lowliest place, and therein stay,
Content to pass away, a thing of nought,
That glory to the Father's name be brought.

Shrink not, O child of God, but fearless go
Down into death with Jesus; thou shalt know
The power of an endless life begin,
With glorious liberty from self and sin.

"Consider Him," and thus thy life shall be
Filled with self-sacrifice and purity;
God will work out in thee the pattern true,
And Christ's example ever keep in view.

"Consider Him," and as you run the race,
Keep ever upward looking in His face;
And thus transformed, illumined thou shalt be,
And Christ's own image shall be seen in thee.--------657
Can you be obedient
To the Lord of all,
Though the earth should totter,
Though the heav'ns should fall?
Face e'en a disaster
With a faith-filled heart,
Knowing naught can harm him
Who with Christ will start?

Can you be obedient
To the Lord you serve,
Never even flinch, friend,
Never even swerve;
Though your next step onward
Seem to lead to death?
Can you then obey Him
Without bated breath?

Can you trust your Leader
When He bids you go
Right into the battle
With a mighty foe?
Can you step up briskly
And with joy obey?
Can you fight the battle,
Till the end of day?

Can you? Then beloved,
Christ just waits for you;
Listen for His orders,
Glad His will to do;
Then when soldiers muster
At the set of sun,
And your name is mentioned,
Christ will say, "Well done."--------658
Walk in the light, and thou shalt know
That fellowship of love
His Spirit only can bestow,
Who reigns in light above.

Walk in the light, and thou shalt find
Thy heart made truly His;
Who dwells in cloudless light enshrined,
In whom no darkness is.

Walk in the light, and sin abhorred
Shall ne'er defile again;
The blood of Jesus Christ the Lord
Shall cleanse from every stain.

Walk in the light, and e'en the tomb
No fearful shade shall wear;
The glory shall dispel the gloom,
For Christ hath conquered there.

Walk in the light, and thou shalt own
Thy darkness passed away,
Because that light hath on thee shone
In which is perfect day.

Walk in the light, thy path shall be
Serene and clear and bright;
For God, by grace, shall dwell in thee,
And God Himself is Light.--------659
Rejoice in the Lord! Oh, let His mercy cheer;
He sunders the bands that enthrall;
Redeemed by His blood, why should we ever fear,
Since Jesus is our all in all?

  If God be for us, if God be for us,
  if God be for us,
  Who can be against us?
  Who? Who? Who?
  Who can be against us, against us?

Be strong in the Lord! Rejoicing in His might,
Be loyal and true day by day;
When evils assail, be valiant for the right,
And He will be our strength and stay.

  If God be for us, if God be for us,
  if God be for us,
  Who can be against us?
  Who? Who? Who?
  Who can be against us, against us?

Confide in His Word, His promises so sure;
In Christ they are yea and amen;
Though earth pass away, they ever shall endure,
'Tis written o'er and o'er again.

  If God be for us, if God be for us,
  if God be for us,
  Who can be against us?
  Who? Who? Who?
  Who can be against us, against us?

Abide in the Lord, secure in His control,
'Tis life everlasting begun;
To pluck from His hand the weakest, trembling soul,
It never, never can be done!

  If God be for us, if God be for us,
  if God be for us,
  Who can be against us?
  Who? Who? Who?
  Who can be against us, against us?--------660
In nothing be anxious; the Lord is at hand.
In peace and in vict'ry triumphantly stand;
Let nothing affright thee and nothing dismay,
For Jesus is coming! It may be today.

In nothing be anxious; on Him roll thy care.
Thy sins were laid on Him, thy sorrows He'll bear;
Care free and triumphant press on, still to prove
The strength of His arm and the balm of His love.

In nothing be anxious; should Jesus delay
His strength will be thine till the end of the day.
His arm thou canst lean on; His Spirit will cheer;
Then wherefore be anxious, press on without fear.--------661
Master, how shall I bless Thy name
For love so great to me,
For sweet enablings of Thy grace,
So sov'reign, yet so free,
That taught me to obey Thy word,
And cast my care on Thee?

No anxious thought upon thy brow
The watching world should see;
No carefulness! O child of God,
For nothing careful be!
But cast thou all thy care on Him
Who always cares for thee.

How shall I praise Thee, Savior dear,
For this new life so sweet,
For taking all the care I laid
At Thy beloved feet,
Keeping Thy hand upon my heart
To still each anxious beat?

I long to praise Thee more, and yet
This is no care to me;
If Thou shalt fill my mouth with songs
Then I shall sing to Thee;
And if my silence praise Thee best,
Then silent I will be.

Yet if it be Thy will, dear Lord,
Oh, send me forth to be
Thy messenger to careful hearts,
To bid them taste, and see
How good Thou art to those who cast
All, all their care on Thee.--------662
"On toward the goal!" Press on!
Alone, yet unafraid;
He cut the path, who beckons thee,
On then, and undismayed.

"On toward the goal!" Press on!
The eyes that are a flame
Are watching thee, what then are men?
What matter praise, or blame?

"On toward the goal!" Press on!
Look not behind thee now,
When just ahead lies His "Well done,"
And crowns await thy brow.

"On toward the goal!" Press on!
Blind, deaf and sometimes dumb
Along the blood-marked, uphill way,
Hard after Christ, press on!--------663
"Forward!" be our watchword,
Steps and voices joined;
Seek the things before us,
Not a look behind;
Burns the fiery pillar
At our army's head;
Who shall dream of shrinking,
By our Captain led?
Forward through the desert,
Through the toil and fight.
Heaven's Kingdom waits us,
Forward into light.

Glories upon glories
Hath our God prepared,
By the souls that love Him,
One day that be shared:
Eye hath not beheld them,
Ear hath never heard;
Nor of these hath uttered
Thought or speech or word;
Forward, marching forward
Where the kingdom's bright,
Till the veil be lifted,
Till our faith be sight!--------664
Rise, my soul, thy God directs thee;
Stranger hands no more impede;
Pass thou on, His strength protects thee,
Strength that has the captive freed.

Is the wilderness before thee,
Desert lands where drought abides?
Heavenly springs shall there restore thee,
Fresh from God's exhaustless tides.

Light divine surrounds thy going,
God Himself shall mark thy way;
Secret blessings, richly flowing,
Lead to everlasting day.

God, thine everlasting portion,
Feeds thee with the Mighty's meat;
Saved from Egypt's hard extortion,
Egypt's food no more to eat.

Art thou weaned from Egypt's pleasures?
God in secret shall thee keep;
There unfold His hidden treasures,
There His love's exhaustless deep.

In the desert God will teach thee
What the God that thou hast found
Patient, gracious, powerful, holy;
All His grace shall there abound.

On to Canaan's rest still wending,
E'en thy wants and woes shall bring
Suited grace from high descending;
Thou shalt taste of mercy's spring.

Though thy way be long and dreary,
Eagle strength He'll still renew;
Garments fresh, and feet unweary,
Tell how God hath brought thee through.

When to Canaan's long-loved dwelling
Love divine thy feet shall bring,
Thou, with shouts of triumph swelling,
Zion's songs in rest shall sing.--------665
Come, let us to the Lord our God
With contrite heart return;
Our God is gracious, nor will leave
The desolate to mourn.

His voice commands the tempest forth,
And stills the stormy wave;
And though His arm be strong to smite,
'Tis also strong to save.

Long hath the night of sorrow reigned;
The dawn shall bring us light;
God shall appear, and we shall rise
With gladness in His sight.

Our heart, if God we seek to know,
Shall know Him, and rejoice;
His coming like the morn shall be,
Like morning songs His voice.

As dew upon the tender herb,
Diffusing fragrance round,
As showers that usher in the spring,
And cheer the thirsty ground;

So shall His presence bless our souls,
And shed a joyful light;
That hallowed morn shall chase away
The sorrows of the night.--------666
Watch, for the night is ending!
Watch, and the world not seek;
Watch, for the day is dawning!
Watch, sink not in sleep.
Watch, for the Lord is coming!
Watch for the foe's attack:
Watch, for the Lord is waiting!
Watch, be never slack.

Watch, and arise in service!
Watch, though the day be drear;
Watch, and go forth to labor!
Watch, the end is near.
Watch and put on thy armor!
Watch with thy spirit strong;
Watch to resist the devil!
Watch, Christ comes ere long.

Watch for the Savior's coming!
Watch for the Morning Star;
Watch and pursue the Kingdom!
Watch with many a scar.
Watch, and be ever watchful!
Watch, till the night is done;
Watch till the dawn of glory!
Watch till the Lord shall come.--------667
  Repeat the last line of each verse

Seek ye first, not earthly pleasure,
Fading joy and failing treasure,
But the love that knows no measure
Seek ye first.

Seek ye first, not earth's aspirings,
Ceaseless longings, vain desirings,
But your precious soul's requirings
Seek ye first.

Seek ye first God's peace and blessing;
Ye have all if this possessing;
Come, your need and sin confessing,
Seek Him first.

Seek Him first, then when forgiven,
Pardoned, with the peace of heaven,
Let your life to Him be given:
Seek this first.

Seek this first  Be pure and holy;
Like the Master, meek and lowly;
Yielded to His service wholly:
Seek this first.

Seek the coming of His kingdom;
Seek the souls around to win them,
Seek to Jesus Christ to bring them:
Seek this first.

Seek this first, His promise trying;
It is sure, all need supplying.
Heavenly things, on Him relying,
Seek ye first.--------668
Have you felt the Father's love?
Still there's more to follow;
And His mercy have you proved?
Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the love the Father shows,
Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His love bestows,
Still there's more to follow.

  More and more, more and more,
  Always more to follow;
  Oh, His matchless, boundless love,
  Still there's more to follow.

Have you felt the Savior near?
Still there's more to follow;
Does His blessed presence cheer?
Still there's more to follow.
Oh, the grace that Jesus shows,
Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His grace bestows,
Still there's more to follow.

  More and more, more and more,
  Always more to follow;
  Oh, His matchless, boundless love,
  Still there's more to follow.

Have you felt the Spirit's power?
Still there's more to follow;
Falling like the gentle shower?
Still there's more to follow;
Oh, the power the Spirit shows,
Still there's more to follow;
Freely He His power bestows,
Still there's more to follow.

  More and more, more and more,
  Always more to follow;
  Oh, His matchless, boundless love,
  Still there's more to follow.--------669
In the heart of Jesus
There is love for you,
Love most pure and tender,
Love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely,
Why for friendship sigh,
When the heart of Jesus
Has a full supply?

In the mind of Jesus
There is thought of you,
Warm as summer sunshine,
Sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful,
Why take anxious thought,
Since the mind of Jesus
Cares for those He bought?

In the field of Jesus
There is work for you;
Such as even angels
Might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing
For some life-work grand,
While the field of Jesus
Seeks your reaping hand?

In the Church of Jesus
There's a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous,
Right and peaceful too;
Why then, like a wand'rer,
Roam with weary pace,
If the Church of Jesus
Holds for you a place?--------670
Take the name of Jesus with you,
Child of sorrow and of woe;
It will joy and comfort give you,
Take it then where'er you go.

  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

Take the name of Jesus ever,
As a shield from every snare.
If temptations round you gather,
Breathe that holy name in prayer.

  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

Oh, the precious name of Jesus,
How it thrills our souls with joy;
All the favor of the Father
In this name we may enjoy.

  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.

At the name of Jesus bowing,
Falling prostrate at His feet,
Claim His vict'ry over evil
And the enemy defeat.

  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n;
  Precious name! Oh, how sweet!
  Hope of earth and joy of heav'n.--------671
Deep down into the depths of this Thy Name,
My God, I sink and dwell in calm delight;
Thou art enough however long the day,
Thou art enough however dark the night.

Thou art my God  the All-Sufficient One,
Thou canst create for me whate'er I lack;
Thy mighty hand has strewn the lonely track
With miracles of love and tender care.

For me Thy trusting one. My God I dare
Once more to fling myself upon Thy breast,
And there adore Thy ways in faith's deep rest,
And there adore Thy ways in faith's quiet rest.--------672
Not what I am, O Lord, but what Thou art;
That, that alone, can be my soul's true rest;
Thy love, not mine, bids fear and doubt depart,
And stills the tempest of my tossing breast.

It is Thy perfect love that casts out fear;
I know the voice that speaks the It is I,
And in these well-known words of heavenly cheer
I hear the joy that bids each sorrow fly.

Thy Name is Love! I hear it from yon Cross;
Thy Name is Love! I read it in yon tomb:
All meaner love is perishable dross,
But this shall light me through time's thickest gloom.

It blesses now, and shall forever bless;
It saves me now, and shall for ever save;
It holds me up in days of helplessness,
It bears me safely o'er each swelling wave.

'Tis what I know of Thee, my Lord and God,
That fills my soul with peace, my lips with song;
Thou art my health, my joy, my staff, my rod;
Leaning on Thee, in weakness I am strong.

More of Thyself, Oh, show me, hour by hour;
More of Thy glory, O my God and Lord;
More of Thyself in all Thy grace and power;
More of Thy love and truth, Incarnate Word.--------673
I take my portion from Thy hand,
And do not seek to understand;
For I am blind, while Thou dost see,
Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

  Whate'er it be! Whate'er it be!
  I do not fear, whate'er it be!
  Thy love divine sustaineth me;
  Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

When darkness doth Thy face obscure,
And many sorrows I endure,
I think of Christ's Gethsemane;
Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

  Whate'er it be! Whate'er it be!
  I do not fear, whate'er it be!
  Thy love divine sustaineth me;
  Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

When tender joys to me are known,
I render thanks to Thee alone;
I know my cup is filled by Thee;
Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

  Whate'er it be! Whate'er it be!
  I do not fear, whate'er it be!
  Thy love divine sustaineth me;
  Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

Thus calmly do I face my lot,
Accept it, Lord, and doubt Thee not;
Lo! All things work for good to me;
Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.

  Whate'er it be! Whate'er it be!
  I do not fear, whate'er it be!
  Thy love divine sustaineth me;
  Thy will is mine, whate'er it be.--------674
The Lord will silently plan for thee,
Thou object of omniscient care;
God undertakes Himself to be
Thy Pilot through each subtle snare.

The Lord will silently plan for thee,
So certainly, He cannot fail!
Rest on the faithfulness of God,
In Him thou surely shalt prevail.

The Lord will silently plan for thee,
Some wonderful surprise of love.
Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
But it is kept for thee to prove.

The Lord will silently plan for thee,
His purpose He'll to thee unfold;
The tangled skein shall shine at last,
A masterpiece of skill untold.

The Lord will silently plan for thee,
A happy child kept in His care
As though no other claimed His love,
But thou alone to Him wert dear.--------675
God moves in a mysterious way
His wonders to perform:
He plants His footsteps in the sea,
And rides upon the storm.

Deep in unfathomable mines
Of never-failing skill,
He treasures up His bright designs,
And works His sovereign will.

Ye fearful saints, fresh courage take;
The clouds ye so much dread
Are big with mercy, and shall break
In blessings on your head.

Judge not the Lord by feeble sense,
But trust Him for His grace;
Behind a frowning providence
He hides a smiling face.

His purpose will ripen fast,
Unfolding every hour:
The bud may have a bitter taste,
But sweet will be the flower.

Blind unbelief is sure to err,
And scan His work in vain;
God is His own Interpreter,
And He will make it plain.--------676
All thy griefs by Him are ordered,
Needful is each one for thee;
All thy tears by Him are counted,
One too much there cannot be;
And if while they fall so quickly
Thou canst own His way is right,
Then each bitter tear of anguish
Precious is in Jesus' sight.

Far too well thy Savior loves thee
To allow thy life to be
One long, calm, unbroken summer
One unruffled, stormless sea;
He would have thee fondly nestling
Closer to His loving breast,
He would have that day seem brighter
When alone is perfect rest.--------677
Art thou sunk in depths of sorrow
Where no arm can reach so low?
There is One whose arms almighty
Reach beyond thy deepest woe.
God th' Eternal is thy refuge,
Let it still thy wild alarms;
Underneath thy deepest sorrow,
Are the everlasting arms.

  Underneath thee, underneath thee,
  Are the everlasting arms,
  Everlasting, everlasting,
  Are the everlasting arms.

Other arms grow faint and weary,
These can never faint, nor fail;
Others reach our mounts of blessing,
These our lowest loneliest vale.
O that all might know His friendship!
O that all might see His charms!
O that all might have beneath them
Jesus' everlasting arms.

  Underneath thee, underneath thee,
  Are the everlasting arms,
  Everlasting, everlasting,
  Are the everlasting arms.

Underneath us, O how easy;
We have not to mount on high,
But to sink into His fulness,
And in trustful weakness lie.
And we find our humbling failures
Save us from the strength that harms!
We may fail, but underneath us
Are the everlasting arms.

  Underneath thee, underneath thee,
  Are the everlasting arms,
  Everlasting, everlasting,
  Are the everlasting arms.

Arms of Jesus! Fold me closer,
To Thy strong and loving breast,
Till my spirit on Thy bosom
Finds its everlasting rest;
And when time's last sands are sinking,
Shield my heart from all alarms,
Softly whispering, "Underneath thee,
Are the everlasting arms."

  Underneath thee, underneath thee,
  Are the everlasting arms,
  Everlasting, everlasting,
  Are the everlasting arms.--------678
I will not be afraid;
I will not be afraid;
I will look upward,
And travel onward,
And not be afraid.

He says He will be with me;
He says He will be with me;
He goes before me,
And is beside me,
So I'm not afraid.

His arms are underneath me;
His arms are underneath me;
His hands uphold me,
His love enfolds me,
So I'm not afraid.

His Word will stand for ever;
His Word will stand for ever;
His truth it shall be
My shield and buckler,
So I'm not afraid.

He will give grace and glory;
He will give grace and glory;
His cross before me,
His banner o'er me,
So I'm not afraid.

So we go singing onward;
So we go singing onward;
We're pressing forward,
We're marching upward,
To Him unafraid.--------679
Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe on His gentle breast,
There by His love o'ershaded,
Sweetly my soul doth rest.
Hark! 'tis a song of heaven
Borne in the sweetest voice,
Echoed by saints in spirit,
Making my heart rejoice.

  Safe in the arms of Jesus,
  Safe on His gentle breast,
  There by His love o'ershaded,
  Sweetly my soul doth rest.

Safe in the arms of Jesus,
Safe from corroding care,
Safe from the world's temptations,
Sin cannot harm me there.
Free from the blight of sorrow,
Free from my doubts and fears;
Only a few more trials,
Only a few more tears.

  Safe in the arms of Jesus,
  Safe on His gentle breast,
  There by His love o'ershaded,
  Sweetly my soul doth rest.

Jesus, my heart's dear Refuge,
Jesus has died for me;
Firm on the Rock of Ages
Ever my trust shall be.
Here let me wait with patience,
Wait till the night is o'er,
Wait till I see the morning
Break on the golden shore.

  Safe in the arms of Jesus,
  Safe on His gentle breast,
  There by His love o'ershaded,
  Sweetly my soul doth rest.--------680
"All in His hands"  what confidence it brings
To tested hearts, to know that all the things
That make up life and circumstance, He holds
In His strong hands, and patiently unfolds
Th' eternal purpose of His sovereign Will
That all things shall His grace and glory fill.

"All in His hands"? Then life with purpose moves
Within the circle of His will, and proves
It good, acceptable. The hands of man
Or Satan cannot mar or foil the plan
Which God ordained  to manifest His Son
In earthen vessels, to a world undone.--------681
Our times are in Thy hand;
O God, we wish them there;
Our lives, our souls, our all, we leave
Entirely to Thy care.

Our times are in Thy hand:
Whatever they may be;
Pleasing or painful, dark or bright,
As best may seem to Thee.

Our times are in Thy hand;
Why should we doubt or fear?
A father's hand will never cause
His child a needless tear.

Our times are in Thy hand;
Jesus, the Crucified,
Whose hand our many sins have pierced,
Is now our guard and guide.

Our times are in Thy hand;
We'll always trust in Thee,
Till we possess the promised crown,
And all Thy glory see.--------682
When I survey life's varied scene,
Amid the darkest hours
Sweet rays of comfort shine between
And thorns are mixed with flowers.

Lord, teach me to adore Thy hand,
From whence my comforts flow,
And let me in this desert land
A glimpse of glory know.

Father, whate'er of earthly bliss
Thy sovereign hand denies,
Accepted at Thy throne of grace,
Let this petition rise:

Give me a calm, a thankful heart,
From every murmur free;
The blessings of Thy grace impart,
And let me live to Thee.

Let the sweet hope that Thou art mine
My life and death attend,
Thy presence through my journey shine,
And crown my journey's end.--------683
God holds the key to all unknown,
And I am glad;
If other hands should hold the key,
Or if He trusted it to me,
I might be sad.

What if tomorrow's cares were here,
Without its rest?
I'd rather He unlocked the day,
And, as the hours swing open, say,
My will is best.

The very dimness of my sight
Makes me secure;
For, groping in my misty way,
I feel His hand; I hear Him say,
My help is sure.

I cannot read His future plans;
But this I know:
I have the smiling of His face,
And all the refuge of His grace
While here below.

Enough; this covers all my wants;
And so I rest;
For what I cannot, He can see,
And in His care I saved shall be,
Forever blest.--------684
Come, ye disconsolate, where'er ye languish;
Come to the mercy-seat, fervently kneel;
Here bring your wounded hearts, here tell your anguish,
Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot heal.

Joy of the comfortless, light of the straying,
Hope of the penitent, fadeless and pure;
Here speaks the Comforter, tenderly saying
Earth has no sorrow that heaven cannot cure.

Here see the Bread of Life; see waters flowing
Forth from the throne of God, pure from above;
Come to the feast of love; come, ever knowing
Earth has no sorrow but heaven can remove.--------685
Lord, Thou art with me!
Whom shall I fear?
Who then can harm me
While Thou art near?
Under Thy shadow
Is my retreat;
There to my taste,
Lord, Thy fruit is sweet.

Lord, Thou art with me,
And Thou dost give
Strength for the journey,
Grace now to live.
Mercies each morning
Thou dost renew;
And for my prospect,
Thy rest in view.

Lord, Thou art with me;
Onward I move;
Each day I'm proving
More of Thy love.
Now Thou art training,
Setting me free
From all that hinders,
To dwell with Thee.--------686
"Fear not, I am with thee";
Blessed golden ray,
Like a star of glory,
Lighting up my way!
Through the clouds of midnight,
This bright promise shone,
"I will never leave thee,
Never will leave thee alone."

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.

Roses fade around me,
Lilies bloom and die,
Earthly sunbeams vanish
Radiant still the sky!
Jesus, Henna-flower,
Blooming for His own,
Jesus, heaven's sunshine,
Never will leave me alone.

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.

Steps unseen before me,
Hidden dangers near;
Nearer still my Savior,
Whispering, "Be of cheer";
Joys, like birds of springtime,
To my heart have flown,
Singing all so sweetly,
"He will not leave me alone."

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone;
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.--------687
O Thou, in whose presence my soul takes delight,
On whom in affliction I call,
My comfort by day and my song in the night,
My hope, my salvation, my all!

Where dost Thou, dear Shepherd, resort with Thy sheep,
To feed them in pastures of love;
Say, why in the valley of death should I weep,
Or alone in this wilderness rove?

Oh, why should I wander, an alien from Thee,
Or cry in the desert for bread?
Thy foes will rejoice when my sorrows they see,
And smile at the tears I have shed.

Ye daughters of Zion, declare, have you seen
The Star that on Israel shone?
Say, if in your tents my Beloved has been,
And where with His flocks He is gone.

Dear Shepherd! I hear, and will follow Thy call;
I know the sweet sound of Thy voice;
Restore and defend me, for Thou art my all,
And in Thee I'll ever rejoice.--------688
I've seen the lightning flashing,
And heard the thunder roll;
I've felt sin's breakers dashing,
Trying to conquer my soul;
I've heard the voice of Jesus,
Telling me still to fight on;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.

The world's fierce winds are blowing,
Temptations are sharp and keen;
I feel a peace in knowing
My Savior stands between;
He stands to shield me from danger,
When earthly friends are gone,
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.

When in affliction's valley,
I'm treading the road of care,
My Savior helps me to carry
My cross when heavy to bear;
My feet entangled with briars,
Ready to cast me down;
My Savior whispered His promise,
Never to leave me alone.

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.

He died for me on the mountain,
For me they pierced His side,
For me He opened that fountain,
The crimson, cleaning tide;
For me He waiteth in glory,
Seated upon His throne;
He promised never to leave me,
Never to leave me alone.

  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone;
  No, never alone,
  No, never alone,
  He promised never to leave me,
  Never to leave me alone.--------689

Hark! The voice of love and mercy
Sounds aloud from Calvary;
See, it rends the rocks asunder,
Shakes the earth, and veils the sky:
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
Hear the dying Savior cry.

Do these charming words afford!

Of the ceremonial law!
Finished all that God had promised;

Join to sing the pleasing theme;
All on earth and all in heaven
Join to praise Immanuel's name:

Glory to the bleeding Lamb!--------692
There's a little word that the Lord has giv'n
For our help in the hour of need:
Let us reckon ourselves to be dead to sin,
To be dead and dead indeed.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.

There's another word that the Lord has giv'n,
In the very same verse we read,
Let us reckon ourselves as alive in Him,
As alive and alive indeed.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.

While we trust in feeling or inward frames
We shall always be tossed about,
Let us anchor fast to the Word of God,
And reckon away our doubt.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.

As the mariner, when the skies are dim,
Sails on by his compass true;
So our faith would cling to the promise firm,
And reckon the journey through.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.

O how sweet it is to be anchored fast
To a hope that can never fail;
Let us reckon on with a firmer trust,
Till we anchor within the veil.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.

You may claim the promise from every pain,
You may know His power to heal;
But your faith must rest in His word alone,
And reckon, rather than feel.

  Let us reckon, reckon, reckon,
  Let us reckon, rather than feel;
  Let us be true to the reck'ning,
  And He will make it real.--------693
He faileth not, for He is God;
He faileth not, His grace how good!
He faileth not, His Word is clear;
If we have God, whom need we fear?

The highest mount, He can make plain;
The wildest flood, He can restrain!
God of Impossibilities!
Poor puny man, now learn His ways.

The axe did swim on Jordan's wave!
Our God the Red Sea's waters clave!
He stopped the sun! Made long the day!
This is the God to whom we pray.

He bars the sea with feeble sand!
The proud waves bow at His command!
If God is thine, what more your need?
Can He not work for you indeed?

Our God is love; your needs are known;
His promises He'll fully own.
Our gracious God bows down His ear
The feeblest, weakest cry to hear.

Our God is light, and never yet,
One promise did He e'er forget.
His promises in Christ the Son
Are fully pledged, Yea and Amen.

Our faithful God, faith cannot break,
Nor death, nor hell, His promise shake!
Who ask in faith, He'll not deny;
His Word is sure, He must reply.

He faileth not, let all men hear;
He faileth not, His Word is clear.
He faileth not, His grace how good;
He faileth not, for He is God!--------694
Be not dismayed whate'er betide,
God will take care of you!
Beneath His wings of love abide,
God will take care of you!

  God will take care of you,
  Through every day o'er all the way;
  He will take care of you;
  God will take care of you!

Through days of toil when heart doth fail,
God will take care of you!
When dangers fierce your path assail,
God will take care of you!

  God will take care of you,
  Through every day o'er all the way;
  He will take care of you;
  God will take care of you!

All you may need He will provide,
God will take care of you!
Trust Him, and you will be satisfied,
God will take care of you!

  God will take care of you,
  Through every day o'er all the way;
  He will take care of you;
  God will take care of you!

Lonely and sad, from friends apart,
God will take care of you!
He will give peace to your aching heart,
God will take care of you!

  God will take care of you,
  Through every day o'er all the way;
  He will take care of you;
  God will take care of you!

No matter what may be the test,
God will take care of you!
Lean, weary one, upon His breast,
God will take care of you!

  God will take care of you,
  Through every day o'er all the way;
  He will take care of you;
  God will take care of you!--------695
Does Jesus care when my heart is pained
Too deeply for mirth or song,
As the burdens press,
And the cares distress,
And the way grows weary and long?

  O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
  His heart is touched with my grief;
  When the days are weary,
  The long night dreary,
  I know my Savior cares.

Does Jesus care when my way is dark
With a nameless dread and fear?
As the daylight fades
Into deep night shades,
Does He care enough to be near?

  O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
  His heart is touched with my grief;
  When the days are weary,
  The long night dreary,
  I know my Savior cares.

Does Jesus care when I've tried and failed
To resist some temptation strong;
When for my deep grief
There is no relief,
Though my tear flow all the night long?

  O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
  His heart is touched with my grief;
  When the days are weary,
  The long night dreary,
  I know my Savior cares.

Does Jesus care when I've said "goodbye"
To the dearest on earth to me,
And my sad heart aches
Till it nearly breaks,
Is it aught to Him? Does He see?

  O yes, He cares, I know He cares,
  His heart is touched with my grief;
  When the days are weary,
  The long night dreary,
  I know my Savior cares.--------696
Cast thou thy care upon the Lord,
The care that loads thy heart;
Take Him this moment at His word,
And let Him do His part.

The need is deep, the care is great,
The burden hard to bear;
Roll it on Him with all its weight,
And leave it resting there.

This heavy thing, it is His gift,
His portion, thee to bless;
Give it Him back; what He shall lift
No more on thee shall press.

Cast all thy care, and not a part,
The great things and the small;
The Lord's all-loving, mighty heart
Has room and thought for all.

Yes, He will ponder every care,
Consider each detail;
Thyself, thy burden, let Him bear;
He will not, cannot, fail.--------697
Weary pilgrim on life's pathway
Struggling on beneath thy load
Hear these words of consolation,
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."

  Cast thy burden on the Lord!
  Cast thy burden on the Lord,
  And He will strengthen thee,
  sustain and comfort thee
  Cast thy burden on the Lord.

Are thy tired feet unsteady?
Does thy lamp no light afford?
Is thy cross too great and heavy?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."

  Cast thy burden on the Lord!
  Cast thy burden on the Lord,
  And He will strengthen thee,
  sustain and comfort thee
  Cast thy burden on the Lord.

Are the ties of friendship severed?
Hushed the voices fondly heard?
Breaks thy heart with weight of anguish?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."

  Cast thy burden on the Lord!
  Cast thy burden on the Lord,
  And He will strengthen thee,
  sustain and comfort thee
  Cast thy burden on the Lord.

Does thy heart with faintness falter?
Does thy mind forget His word?
Does thy strength succumb to weakness?
"Cast thy burden on the Lord."

  Cast thy burden on the Lord!
  Cast thy burden on the Lord,
  And He will strengthen thee,
  sustain and comfort thee
  Cast thy burden on the Lord.

He will hold thee up from falling;
He will guide thy steps aright;
He will strengthen each endeavor;
He will keep thee by His might.

  Cast thy burden on the Lord!
  Cast thy burden on the Lord,
  And He will strengthen thee,
  sustain and comfort thee
  Cast thy burden on the Lord.--------698
Amid the trials that I meet,
Amid the thorns that pierce my feet,
One thought remains supremely sweet
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  What need I fear when Thou art near,
  And thinkest, Lord, of me!

The cares of life come thronging fast,
Upon my soul their shadows cast;
Their gloom reminds my heart at last
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  What need I fear when Thou art near,
  And thinkest, Lord, of me!

Let shadows come, let shadows go,
Let life be bright, or dark with woe,
I am content, for this I know
Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!

  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  Thou thinkest, Lord, of me!
  What need I fear when Thou art near,
  And thinkest, Lord, of me!--------699
In the hour of trial,
Jesus, plead for me,
Lest by base denial,
I depart from Thee;
When Thou seest me waver,
With a look recall,
Nor for fear or favor
Suffer me to fall.

Should Thy mercy send me
Sorrow, toil, and woe;
Or should pain attend me
On my path below;
Grant that I may never
Fail Thy hand to see;
Grant that I may ever
Cast my care on Thee.

When the last hour cometh,
Fraught with strife and pain,
When Thou, Lord, returneth
To the earth again;
On Thy truth relying
As that hour draws near,
Jesus, take me, waiting,
To Thy presence dear.--------700
"Be not anxious for the morrow,"
Jesus said;
Why should we its trials borrow?
Trust instead!
For each hour of need or sorrow,
Grace He gives, and daily bread.

Thus our treasures safe investing
In His care,
Kept in His pavilion resting,
May we dare
Still to trust, thru faith's deep testing,
Sure, God will His ways declare.--------701
All the way my Savior leads me;
What have I to ask beside?
Can I doubt His tender mercy,
Who through life has been my Guide?
Heav'nly peace, divinest comfort,
Here by faith in Him to dwell!
For I know, whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well,
For I know, whate'er befall me,
Jesus doeth all things well.

All the way my Savior leads me,
Cheers each winding path I tread,
Gives me grace for every trial,
Feeds me with the living bread.
Though my weary steps may falter,
And my soul athirst may be,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see,
Gushing from the Rock before me,
Lo! A spring of joy I see.

All the way my Savior leads me;
Oh, the fullness of His grace!
Perfect rest to me is promised
In my Father's blest embrace.
When my spirit, clothed immortal,
Wings its flight to realms of day,
This my song through endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way,
This my song through endless ages:
Jesus led me all the way.--------702
'Tis now in part I know His grace;
I catch sweet glimpses of His face,
But in that better world of His,
I shall behold Him as He is.

  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne;
  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne.

'Tis now in part I know His love;
Bright sunbeams shine from skies above;
But glories more exceeding far,
Shall rise beyond life's evening star.

  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne;
  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne.

'Tis now in part I understand
The leadings of my Father's hand;
But I shall own His ways were right,
When welcomed to His presence bright.

  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne;
  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne.

'Tis now in part, but O how sweet
To rest by faith at His dear feet;
Though now we see as through a glass,
The veil will lift, the shadows pass.

  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne;
  Then shall I know as I am known,
  And sing His praise before the throne.--------703
Precious promise God doth give thee,
Thou, the weary passerby,
On the way from earth to glory:
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

  I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye;
  On the way from earth to glory,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye.

When temptations fierce assail thee,
When thy trusted helpers fly,
Let this promise ring within thee,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

  I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye;
  On the way from earth to glory,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye.

When thy secret hopes have perished
In the grave of years gone by,
Let this promise still be cherished,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

  I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye;
  On the way from earth to glory,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye.

When the shades of life are falling,
And the hour has come to die,
Hear thy faithful Pilot calling,
"I will guide thee with Mine eye."

  I will guide thee, I will guide thee,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye;
  On the way from earth to glory,
  I will guide thee with Mine eye.--------704
Though troubles assail,
And dangers affright;
Though friends should all fail,
And foes all unite,
Yet one thing secures us,
Whatever betide:
The Scripture assures us,
"The Lord will provide."

The birds, without barn
Or storehouse, are fed;
From them let us learn
To trust for our bread;
His saints what is fitting
Shall ne'er be denied,
So long as 'tis written,
"The Lord will provide."

His call we obey,
Like Abram of old,
Not knowing our way,
But faith makes us bold;
For though we are strangers,
We have a good Guide;
And trust in all dangers:
"The Lord will provide."

When Satan appears
To stop up our path,
And fills us with fears,
We triumph by faith;
He cannot take from us,
Though oft he has tried,
The heart-cheering promise,
"The Lord will provide."

He tells us we're weak,
Our hope is in vain;
The good that we seek
We ne'er shall obtain;
But when such suggestions
Our faith thus have tried,
This answers all questions,
"The Lord will provide."

No strength of our own,
Nor goodness we claim;
Our trust is all thrown
On Jesus' dear name.
In this our strong tower
For safety we hide;
The Lord is our power,
"The Lord will provide."

When life sinks apace,
And death is in view,
The word of His grace
Shall comfort us through;
Not fearing or doubting,
With Christ on our side,
We hope to die shouting,
"The Lord will provide."--------705
In some way or other the Lord will provide:
It may not be my way, it may not be thy way;
And yet in His own way, "the Lord will provide."

  Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
  Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.

At some time or other the Lord will provide:
It may not be my time, it may not be thy time;
And yet in His own time, "the Lord will provide."

  Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
  Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.

Despond then no longer; the Lord will provide:
And this be the token  no word He hath spoken
Was ever yet broken: "The Lord will provide."

  Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
  Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.

March on then right boldly: the sea shall divide;
The pathway made glorious, with shoutings victorious,
We'll join in the chorus, "The Lord will provide."

  Then we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide;
  Yes, we'll trust in the Lord, and He will provide.--------706
Sometimes a light surprises
The Christian while he sings;
It is the Lord who rises
With healing in His wings;
When comforts are declining,
He grants the soul again
A season of clear shining,
To cheer it after rain.

In holy contemplation
We sweetly then pursue
The theme of God's salvation,
And find it ever new;
Set free from present sorrow,
We cheerfully can say
E'en let the unknown morrow
Bring with it what it may.

It can bring with it nothing,
But He will bear us through;
Who gives the lilies clothing,
Will clothe His people too:
Beneath the spreading heavens
No creature but is fed;
And He, who feeds the ravens,
Will give His children bread.

Though vine nor fig tree neither
Their wonted fruit shall bear;
Though all the fields should wither
Nor flocks nor herds be there;
Yet God the same abiding,
His praise shall tune my voice,
For, while in Him confiding,
I cannot but rejoice.--------707
When upon life's billows you are tempest tossed,
When you are discouraged, thinking all is lost,
Count your many blessing name them one by one,
And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

  Count your blessings, name them one by one;
  Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

Are you ever burdened with a load of care?
Does the cross seem heavy you are called to bear?
Count your many blessings, every doubt will fly,
And you will be singing as the days go by.

  Count your blessings, name them one by one;
  Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

When you look at others with their lands and gold,
Think that Christ has promised you His wealth untold.
Count your many blessings, money cannot buy
Your reward in heaven, nor your Lord on high.

  Count your blessings, name them one by one;
  Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.

So amid the conflict, whether great or small,
Do not be discouraged, God is over all;
Count your many blessings, angels will attend,
Help and comfort give you to your journey's end.

  Count your blessings, name them one by one;
  Count your blessings, see what God hath done;
  Count your blessings, name them one by one,
  And it will surprise you what the Lord hath done.--------708
Fresh as the dew of the morning,
Bringing a sweet rest unheard,
Christ, in the gentle anointing,
Whispers His comforting word:
Stand till the trial is over,
Stand till the tempest is gone,
Stand for the glory of Jesus,
Stand till the kingdom is won.

  Lord of all hope, O how
  sweet is Thy voice,
  Making my heart in Thy
  presence rejoice.

If in the test of my trouble,
Faint be my spirit and heart,
Faith, with the star of hope glimm'ring,
Shall all be taken apart,
May then Thy faith with Thy life-pow'r
Over me hold its full sway
That all Thy riches of glory
Now I may share and for aye.

  Lord of all hope, O how
  sweet is Thy voice,
  Making my heart in Thy
  presence rejoice.

Lord, as the morning sun dawning,
Chase all my darkness away,
And with Thy kind wings of healing
Turn all my night into day.
Come Thou, O come, Lord of comfort,
Come to my sad, weary heart,
Come, O Thou blest hope of glory,
Never, O never depart.

  Lord of all hope, O how
  sweet is Thy voice,
  Making my heart in Thy
  presence rejoice.--------709
Jesus triumphant when the storm-clouds break,
And the loud thunder bids the soul awake;
When biting blasts lay earthly projects low,
And one by one the fondest treasures go.

Jesus triumphant, through the fleeting years;
Jesus triumphant, spite of blinding tears;
High over all, to hear Thy loving voice,
Which bids the heart look upward and rejoice.

Jesus triumphant, when in work for Thee,
Sad and disheartened, no results we see;
When gathered force of evil seems to win,
And work for Christ seems lost in work of sin.

Jesus triumphant all along the line;
Triumphant Savior, all Thy triumph mine;
For since I am a partner in Thy love,
My life on earth is lived through Thee above.

Jesus triumphant when the spirit wings
Onward and upward to the King of kings;
And through the last great triumph of Thy grace
Triumphant saints shall see Thee face to face.--------710
The days may yet grow darker,
The nights more weary grow,
And Jesus may still tarry,
But this one thing I know:
The Lord will still grow dearer,
And fellowship will be
The closer and the sweeter
Between my Lord and me.

'Tis our dear Lord we wait for,
Our Hope! Our Joy! Our Friend!
Himself we long to welcome,
And just beyond the bend
Hidden, perchance to meet us
Before the day is done,
The waiting will be over
And rest will have begun.--------711
I know not what awaits me,
God kindly veils my eyes,
And o'er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And every joy He sends me comes
A sweet and glad surprise.

  Where He may lead I'll follow,
  My trust in Him repose;
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."

One step I see before me,
'Tis all I need to see,
The light of heaven more brightly shines
When earth's illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence comes,
His loving, "Trust in Me!"

  Where He may lead I'll follow,
  My trust in Him repose;
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."

Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
'Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him who loves me so.

  Where He may lead I'll follow,
  My trust in Him repose;
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."

So on I go not knowing;
I would not if might;
I'd rather walk in the dark with God
Than go alone in the light;
I'd rather walk by faith with Him
Than go alone by sight.

  Where He may lead I'll follow,
  My trust in Him repose;
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows";
  And every hour in perfect peace,
  I'll sing, "He knows, He knows."--------712
Be still, my heart! These anxious cares
To thee are burdens, thorns and snares;
They cast dishonor on the Lord,
And contradict His gracious word.

Brought safely by His hand thus far,
Why wilt thou now give place to fear?
How canst thou want if He provide,
Or lose thy way with such a Guide?

When first before His mercy-seat
Thou didst to Him thine all commit;
He gave thee warrant from that hour
To trust His wisdom, love, and power.

Did ever trouble yet befall,
And He refuse to hear thy call?
And has He not His promise passed,
That thou shalt overcome at last?

He who has helped me hitherto
Will help me all my journey through,
And give me daily cause to raise
New Ebenezers to His praise.

Though rough and thorny be the road,
It leads thee on, apace, to God;
Then count thy present trials small,
For God will make amends for all.--------713
Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here;
Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,
I've no cause for worry or for fear.
He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Gives unto each day what He deems best,
Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow'r.
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
"As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,"
This the pledge to me He made.

Help me then, in every tribulation,
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith's sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E'er to take, as from a father's hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting.
Till with Christ the Lord I stand.--------714
Through all the changing scenes of life,
In trouble and in joy,
The praises of my God shall still
My heart and tongue employ.

Oh, magnify the Lord with me,
With me exalt His name;
When in distress to Him I called,
He to my rescue came.

The hosts of God encamp around
The dwellings of the just;
Deliverance He affords to all
Who on His succor trust.

Oh, make but trial of His love,
Experience will decide
How blest they are, and only they,
Who in His truth confide.

Fear Him, ye saints, and you will then
Have nothing else to fear;
Make you His service your delight,
Your wants shall be His care.--------715
Not now, but in the coming years,
It may be when with Christ we stand,
We'll read the meaning of our tears,
And there, sometime, we'll understand.

  Then trust in God through all thy days;
  Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
  Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
  Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.

We'll catch the broken thread again,
And finish what we here began;
God will the mysteries explain,
And then, ah, then, we'll understand.

  Then trust in God through all thy days;
  Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
  Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
  Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.

We'll know why clouds instead of sun
Were over many a cherished plan;
Why song has ceased when scarce begun;
'Tis then, sometime, we'll understand.

  Then trust in God through all thy days;
  Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
  Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
  Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.

Why what we long for most of all,
Eludes so oft our eager hand;
Why hopes are crushed and castles fall,
Till then, sometime, we'll understand.

  Then trust in God through all thy days;
  Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
  Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
  Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.

God knows the way, He holds the key,
He guides us with unerring hand;
Sometime with tearless eyes we'll see;
Yes, then, 'tis then, we'll understand.

  Then trust in God through all thy days;
  Fear not, for He doth hold thy hand;
  Though dark thy way, still sing and praise,
  Sometime, sometime, we'll understand.--------716
Begone, unbelief,
My Savior is near,
And for my relief
Will surely appear;
By prayer let me wrestle,
And He will perform;
With Christ in the vessel,
I smile at the storm.

Though dark be my way,
Since He is my Guide,
'Tis mine to obey,
'Tis His to provide;
Though cisterns be broken,
And creatures all fail,
The word He hath spoken
Shall surely prevail.

His love, in time past,
Forbids me to think
He'll leave me at last
In trouble to sink:
Each sweet Ebenezer
I have in review
Confirms His good pleasure
To help me quite through.

Why should I complain
Of want or distress,
Temptation or pain?
He told me no less;
The heirs of salvation,
I know from His Word,
Through much tribulation
Must follow their Lord.

How bitter that cup
No heart can conceive,
Which He drank quite up,
That sinners might live!
His way was much rougher
And darker than mine;
Did Christ, my Lord, suffer,
And shall I repine?

Since all that I meet
Shall work for my good,
The bitter is sweet,
The medicine, food;
Though painful at present,
'Twill cease before long,
And then, oh, how pleasant
The conqueror's song!--------717
O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
Though all things around us be trying,
Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,
It's better to sing than be sighing.

  Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
  It is better to sing than be sighing:
  It is better to live than be dying;
  So let us rejoice evermore.

O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
When the darts of the tempter are flying,
For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,
Our singing much more than our sighing.

  Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
  It is better to sing than be sighing:
  It is better to live than be dying;
  So let us rejoice evermore.

O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
When sickness upon us is stealing,
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
For joy is the fountain of healing.

  Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
  It is better to sing than be sighing:
  It is better to live than be dying;
  So let us rejoice evermore.--------718
Peace, perfect peace, in this dark world of sin?
The blood of Jesus whispers peace within.

Peace, perfect peace, by thronging duties pressed?
To do the will of Jesus  this is rest.

Peace, perfect peace, with sorrows surging round?
On Jesus' bosom naught but calm is found.

Peace, perfect peace, with loved ones far away?
In Jesus' keeping we are safe, and they.

Peace, perfect peace, our future all unknown?
Jesus we know, and He is on the throne.--------719
Like a river, glorious
Is God's perfect peace,
Over all victorious
In its bright increase;
Perfect, yet it floweth
Fuller every day,
Perfect, yet it groweth
Deeper all the way.

  Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
  Hearts are fully blest;
  Finding, as He promised,
  Perfect peace and rest.

Hidden in the hollow
Of His blessed hand,
Never foe can follow,
Never traitor stand;
Not a surge of worry,
Not a shade of care,
Not a blast of hurry
Touch the spirit there.

  Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
  Hearts are fully blest;
  Finding, as He promised,
  Perfect peace and rest.

Every joy or trial
Falleth from above,
Traced upon our dial
By the Sun of Love.
We must trust Him fully
All for us to do;
They who trust Him wholly
Find Him wholly true.

  Stayed upon Christ Jesus,
  Hearts are fully blest;
  Finding, as He promised,
  Perfect peace and rest.--------720
God hath not promised skies always blue,
Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;
God hath not promised sun without rain,
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.

  But God hath promised strength for the day,
  Rest for the labor, light for the way,
  Grace for the trials, help from above,
  Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.

  But God hath promised strength for the day,
  Rest for the labor, light for the way,
  Grace for the trials, help from above,
  Unfailing sympathy, undying love.

God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain, rocky and steep,
Never a river, turbid and deep.

  But God hath promised strength for the day,
  Rest for the labor, light for the way,
  Grace for the trials, help from above,
  Unfailing sympathy, undying love.--------721
I'll sing of the wonderful promise
That Jesus has given to me;
"My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee."
And lest my poor heart should forget it,
Or ever forgetful should be,
He still keeps repeating the promise,
My grace is sufficient for thee.

  Yes, over and over and over,
  My Savior keeps saying to me;
  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
  My grace is sufficient for thee.

His grace is sufficient to save me,
And cleanse me from guilt and from sin;
Sufficient to sanctify wholly,
And give me His Spirit within.
His grace is sufficient for trials,
No matter how hard they may be,
This promise stands over against them,
My grace is sufficient for thee.

  Yes, over and over and over,
  My Savior keeps saying to me;
  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
  My grace is sufficient for thee.

His grace is sufficient for sickness,
Sustaining and making me whole;
His grace is sufficient when sorrows
Like billows roll over the soul.
His grace is sufficient for service,
It sets us from selfishness free,
And sends us to tell the tried ones,
His grace is sufficient for thee.

  Yes, over and over and over,
  My Savior keeps saying to me;
  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
  My grace is sufficient for thee.

His grace is sufficient to live by,
And should we be summoned to die
'Twill light up the valley of shadows,
And bear us away to Him nigh.
Or when we shall stand in His vict'ry,
And Christ in His glory shall see,
We'll fall at His footstool confessing,
Thy grace was sufficient for me.

  Yes, over and over and over,
  My Savior keeps saying to me;
  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
  My grace is sufficient for thee.

It is not our grace that's sufficient,
But His grace, it ever must be:
Our graces are transient and changing;
His grace is unfailing as He.
And so I am ever repeating
His wonderful promise to me,
My strength is made perfect in weakness,
My grace is sufficient for thee.

  Yes, over and over and over,
  My Savior keeps saying to me;
  My strength is made perfect in weakness,
  My grace is sufficient for thee.--------722
The cross that He gave may be heavy,
But it ne'er outweighs His grace;
The storm that I feared may surround me,
But it ne'er excludes His face.

  The cross is not greater than His grace,
  The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
  I am satisfied to know
  That with Jesus here below,
  I can conquer every foe.

The thorns in my path are not sharper
Than composed His crown for me;
The cup that I drink not more bitter
Than He drank at Gethsemane.

  The cross is not greater than His grace,
  The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
  I am satisfied to know
  That with Jesus here below,
  I can conquer every foe.

The light of His love shineth brighter,
As it falls on paths of woe;
The toil of my work groweth lighter,
As I stoop to raise the low.

  The cross is not greater than His grace,
  The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
  I am satisfied to know
  That with Jesus here below,
  I can conquer every foe.

His will I have joy in fulfilling,
As I'm walking in His sight;
My trials more blessings are bringing,
Christ in them is my delight.

  The cross is not greater than His grace,
  The storm cannot hide His blessed face;
  I am satisfied to know
  That with Jesus here below,
  I can conquer every foe.--------723
He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,
He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,
To added affliction He addeth His mercy,
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.

When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father's full giving is only begun.

His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
His power no boundary known unto men,
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He giveth and giveth and giveth again.--------724
A little bird I am,
Shut from the fields of air,
And in my cage I sit and sing
To Him who placed me there;
Well pleased a prisoner to be,
Because, my God, it pleaseth Thee.

Nought have I else to do,
I sing the whole day long;
And He whom most I love to please
Doth listen to my song;
He caught and bound my wandering wing;
But still He bends to hear me sing.

Thou hast an ear to hear
A heart to love and bless;
And though my notes were e'er so rude,
Thou wouldst not hear the less;
Because Thou knowest as they fall,
That love, sweet love, inspires them all.

My cage confines me round;
Abroad I cannot fly;
But though my wing is closely bound,
My heart's at liberty;
For prison walls cannot control
The flight, the freedom of the soul.

O it is good to soar
These bolts and bars above!
To Him whose purpose I adore,
Whose providence I love;
And in Thy mighty will to find
The joy, the freedom of the mind.--------725
Strong are the walls around me,
That hold me all the day;
But they who thus have bound me,
Cannot keep God away:
My very dungeon walls are dear,
Because the God I love is here.

They know, who thus oppress me,
'Tis hard to be alone;
But know not One can bless me,
Who comes through bars and stone;
He makes my dungeon's darkness bright,
And fills my bosom with delight.

Thy love, O God, restores me
From sighs and tears to praise;
And deep my soul adores Thee,
Nor thinks of time or place:
I ask no more, in good or ill,
But union with Thy holy will.

'Tis that which make me treasure,
'Tis that which brings me gain;
Converting woe to pleasure,
And reaping joy from pain.
Oh, 'tis enough, whate'er befall,
To know that God is All in all.--------726
Long plunged in sorrow, I resign
My soul to that dear hand of Thine,
Without reserve or fear;
That hand shall wipe my streaming eyes,
Or into smiles of glad surprise
Transform the falling tear.

Adieu! Ye vain delights of earth;
Insipid sports, and childish mirth,
I taste no sweets in you;
Unknown delights are in the cross,
All joy beside to me is dross;
And Jesus thought so too.

The Cross! O ravishment and bliss
How grateful e'en its anguish is;
Its bitterness how sweet!
There every sense, and all the mind,
In all her faculties refined,
Taste happiness complete.

Self-love no grace in sorrow sees,
Consults her own peculiar ease:
'Tis all the bliss she knows;
But nobler aims true love employ.
In self-denial is her joy,
In suffering her repose.

Thy choice and mine shall be the same,
Inspirer of that holy flame
Which must forever blaze!
To take the cross and follow Thee,
Where love and duty lead, shall be
My portion and my praise.--------727
Light after darkness,
Gain after loss,
Strength after weakness,
Crown after cross;
Sweet after bitter,
Hope after fears,
Home after wand'ring,
Praise after tears.

Sheaves after sowing,
Sun after rain,
Sight after mystery,
Peace after pain;
Joy after sorrow,
Calm after blast,
Rest after weariness,
Sweet rest at last.

Near after distant,
Gleam after gloom,
Love after loneliness,
Life after tomb;
After long agony,
Rapture of bliss,
Right was the pathway,
Leading to this.--------728
I have been through the valley of sorrow and weeping,
The valley of trouble and pain;
But the "God of all comfort," the "God of all comfort,"
Was with me to hold and sustain.

As the earth needs the clouds and the rain with the sunshine,
Our souls need both sorrow and joy,
So He places us oft in the fire of affliction
The dross from the gold to destroy.

When He leads thru the valleys of trouble and sorrow,
His mercy and love there we trace;
For the trials and sorrows He sends us in wisdom
Are part of His lessons in grace.

Yet how often we shrink from the purging and pruning,
Forgetting the Husbandman knows
That the deeper and closer the cutting and paring,
The richer the cluster that grows.

O how well does He know that afflictions are needed;
He has a wise purpose in view,
And within the dark valley He whispers to comfort,
"Hereafter thou'lt know what I do."

As we travel the pathway thru life's shadowed valleys,
Fresh springs of His love ever rise;
And we learn that our troubles, our sorrows and losses,
Are blessings just sent in disguise.

So we'll follow Him faithfully where'er He leadeth,
The pathway be dreary or bright;
For we've proved that our God is the "God of all comfort,"
The God who gives songs in the night.--------729
Is it raining, little flower?
Oh, be glad of rain!
Too much sun would wither thee;
Soon 'twill shine again.
Though the sky is black, 'tis true,
Yet behind it shines the blue.

Art thou weary, tender heart?
Oh, be glad of pain;
Sweetest things in sorrow grow
As the flow'rs in rain.
God is watching, thou'lt have sun
When the clouds their work have done.--------730
Pressed out of measure, pressed beyond all length;
Pressed so intensely, seeming beyond strength;
Pressed in the body, pressed within the soul,
Pressed in the mind till darksome surges roll.

  God is my hope and God is my joy;
  He is the resurrection life I enjoy.

Pressure by foes, and pressure from our friends;
Pressure on pressure, till life nearly ends;
Pressed into knowing none to help but God,
Pressed into loving both the staff and the rod.

  God is my hope and God is my joy;
  He is the resurrection life I enjoy.

Pressed into liberty where nothing clings,
Pressed into faith for hard and hopeless things;
Pressed into life, a life in Christ the Lord,
Pressed into life, the life of Christ outpoured.

  God is my hope and God is my joy;
  He is the resurrection life I enjoy.--------731
Why should I fear the darkest hour,
Or tremble at the tempter's power?
Jesus vouchsafes to be my tower.

Though hot the fight, why quit the field?
Why must I either fly or yield,
Since Jesus is my mighty shield?

When creature comforts fade and die,
Worldlings may weep, but why should I?
Jesus still lives, and still is nigh.

Though all the flocks and herds were dead,
My soul a famine need not dread,
For Jesus is my living bread.

I know not what may soon betide,
Or how my wants shall be supplied;
But Jesus knows, and will provide.

Though sin would fill me with distress,
The throne of grace I dare address,
For Jesus is my righteousness.

Though faint my prayers and cold my love,
My steadfast hope shall not remove,
While Jesus intercedes above.

Against me earth and hell combine;
But on my side is power divine;
Jesus is all, and He is mine!--------732
My Father is rich in houses and lands,
He holdeth the wealth of the world in His hands!
Of rubies and diamonds, of silver and gold,
His coffers are full, He has riches untold.

  I'm a child of the King,
  A child of the King:
  With Jesus my Savior,
  I'm a child of the King.

My Father's own Son, the Savior of men,
Once wandered on earth as the poorest of them.
But now He is pleading our pardon on high,
That we may be His when He comes by and by.

  I'm a child of the King,
  A child of the King:
  With Jesus my Savior,
  I'm a child of the King.

I once was an out-cast stranger on earth,
A sinner by choice, and an alien by birth;
But I've been adopted, my name's written down,
An heir of salvation, the kingdom and crown.

  I'm a child of the King,
  A child of the King:
  With Jesus my Savior,
  I'm a child of the King.

Though poor on this earth, oh, why should I care?
Since glorious things for me God doth prepare;
Though trials abound, yet, still I may sing:
All glory to God, I'm a child of the King.

  I'm a child of the King,
  A child of the King:
  With Jesus my Savior,
  I'm a child of the King.--------733
In Eden's garden fair we see
That God before two trees placed man,
The trees of life, and knowledge too,
Which for the Lord and Satan stand.

The tree of life the center is
Of God's eternal, perfect plan,
Denoting God in Christ as life
To be received as all by man.

The tree of knowledge standing there,
Bespeaks a sure and warning voice:
Outside of God there is a source
Of death to all who make this choice.

If man would eat the tree of life,
Then God as life he will receive,
And be transformed to precious stones,
God's will and purpose to achieve.

If man the tree of knowledge takes,
Then Satan enters into man
As sin, which brings him into death,
That he may not fulfill God's plan.

This signifies that only God
Is our full source of life and breath;
To touch ought else is but to touch
The source of knowledge and of death.

For knowledge only bringeth death,
Though evil or though good it seem;
For any thing apart from God,
Is but the fruit of Satan's scheme.

Not only evil, but the good
Is contradictory to Christ;
Not only knowledge of the bad,
But even good is versus Christ.

Lord, teach us only Thee to touch,
That with Thy life we filled may be,
And not to touch the good or bad,
Or anything apart from Thee.--------734
The law of God is holy, good,
To practise good it doth command;
Its purpose is to clearly show
That we cannot meet God's demand.

Yet in our mind there is a law
Which always tries the good to do;
But in our members is a law
Which always doth this law subdue.

The law within our mind is good,
'Tis of our human life obtained
At our creation from the Lord,
That good behavior be maintained.

The law within our members is
The evil of satanic life;
Into our members at the fall
It came thru Satan's subtle strife.

This evil law of Satan is
The law of sin, in us its seat;
'Tis stronger than the law of good
And always brings it to defeat.

But in our spirit is a law,
Which is the Spirit's law of life;
'Tis of the very life of God
Which we from our rebirth derive.

This law divine the strongest is,
Transcending all the others o'er;
From sin's law freeing, it fulfills
The full requirement of God's law.

We then must always set our mind
Upon the spirit deep within,
And not upon the things of flesh,
The body ruined by the sin.

To set the mind upon the flesh
Is sin and death and darkest night;
The mind upon the spirit set
Is life and peace and full of light.

10 This is the way of true release!
This is the way of victory!
Lord, may we in the spirit live,
And by the Spirit walk with Thee.--------735
The law of letters God defines,
It is His testimony true;
It shows how loving, holy, just,
Is God, with whom we have to do.

According to His nature shown
God's law requires that we must live,
That He our souls may justify
And unto us His blessing give.

The law can never give us life,
Nor any strength to us supply,
But doth its full demands exact
And all our weakness show thereby.

It was not for God's final plan,
But for man's sin was introduced,
That man by breaking it might know
Himself, his sin to him adduced.

'Tis by the law all mouths are stopped
And all are shut up under sin;
It brings us to the Christ of God
That God may bless us all in Him.

The law is but a type of Christ,
Who God's full testimony is,
Who fully has expressed His love,
His holiness and righteousness.

'Tis Christ, God's testimony real,
Who doth with life divine supply,
That with the law's demands we may
Be more than able to comply.

God's living testimony, He;
By whom God's potent life we share;
Thru Him we're dead unto the law,
And in His Spirit fruit we bear.--------736
In ancient times the law of God
In letter was engraved on stone;
But now it is a law of life,
Which in our heart is written down.

The law in letters good demands
And thus our utter weakness shows;
But now the law of life sustains,
And strength for God to please bestows.

The law in letters brings to us
God's knowledge only outwardly;
But now the law of life supplies
A deeper knowledge inwardly.

The law in letters can but rule
By dead commandments outwardly;
But now the law of life controls
By living knowledge inwardly.

This living law is moving now
In all of our experience,
To regulate us from within
And check us by our inner sense.

How deep its regulation is
Within the inmost part of us,
A living consciousness to give,
And God Himself impart to us.

'Tis by this living law of life
We need no teaching outwardly,
For all God's living knowledge now
This law will teach us inwardly.

Lord, teach us by this law to walk,
Its inner ruling to obey,
That we may of Thyself partake
And know Thee in a living way.--------737
Life eternal brings us
Fellowship of life,
Fellowship in Spirit,
Saving us from strife.

Life eternal give us
Fellowship divine;
Thus the Lord as Spirit
May with us combine.

It is life in Spirit
Brings this fellowship;
Fellowship in Spirit
Doth with grace equip.

We, by life's enabling,
Fellowship aright;
Fellowship in Spirit
Brings us into light.

By the outward cleansing,
Fellowship we keep;
Inwardly anointed,
Fellowship we reap.

Fellowship is deepened
Thru the cross of death;
Fellowship is lifted
By the Spirit's breath.

Fellowship will free us
From our sinful self;
Fellowship will bring us
Into God Himself.--------738
There is a certain sense of life
With life of every kind;
And in th' eternal life in us
It is a sense divine.

The higher any life may be,
The better is its sense;
The life divine the highest is
And has the highest sense.

It is the sense of life in us,
It is the sense of God;
'Tis in our spirit made alive,
And more than sense of good.

It is the inner sense in us,
The inmost consciousness,
Discerning matters inwardly,
God's will to thus express.

'Tis by this sense that God we know,
The sense of inner life;
'Tis pow'rful and spontaneous,
And not of any strife.

The greater is our growth in life,
The keener is this sense;
The more we walk and act in life,
The more it is intense.

The sense of life when exercised
Will make our spirit bold,
And by this inner sense of God
True fellowship we hold.--------739
In those regenerated by the Lord
There is an inner knowledge bountiful;
Thus we the outward teachings do not need,
But God we inwardly may know in full.

Eternal life, the highest and the best,
Possesses full divine capacity,
That by this life God's knowledge we may have
More than by knowledge given outwardly.

The law of life is put within our mind
And on our heart 'tis written sovereignly,
Inwardly ruling us that God we know
More than by teachings given outwardly.

Holy anointing in our spirit dwells,
Showing the things of God to mind and heart;
By this anointing we God's knowledge have
More than man's teachings can to us impart.

We have the triune God indwelling us,
Living and acting, working all the time,
That by the inner sense we have of Him
God we may know in magnitude sublime.

This inner knowledge obviates the need
Of outward knowledge, human eloquence,
But in the spirit we must ever live
And walk according to the inner sense.

The more we live in Christ, the life divine,
And by the inner consciousness behave,
The more we'll have the inward knowledge true,
And on our heart God will His Son engrave.

'Tis by this living inward knowledge gained
That fellowship with God in life we hold;
'Tis by this hidden knowledge thus obtained
God unto us His fulness doth unfold.--------740
The principle of incarnation
Is but the blend of God and man,
Both acting in cooperation
To thus fulfill th' eternal plan.

To God, the man in His expression,
And man is of God's life possessed;
The man is wholly God's possession,
And God thru man is thus expressed.

Redemption is accomplished fully
In man, God's wisdom thus to show;
Salvation is expounded wholly
By man, that all creation know.

God's service in this dispensation
Requires that man should work with Him;
Thus God and man in close relation
And joint dependence work therein.

It is not God Himself to labor,
Nor man to try to serve alone,
But God and man to work together
Each moment that His plan be shown.

The principle of incarnation
To all our work we must apply,
To all our gift and operation,
That we as one may serve thereby.--------741
God ordained us unto sonship,
Ere creation's work was done,
To conform us by His Spirit
To the image of His Son;
That His only dear Begotten
Might become the firstborn One,
And by Him with many brethren
His expression full be won.

By divine regeneration
We the sons of God became,
But we must mature to fullness,
Thus the birthright to obtain.
Born and fully grown to manhood,
God's adoption we may share;
By the measure of full stature,
We God's sonship will declare.

All our spirit, soul and body
Unto Christ conformed must be;
This will be accomplished fully
When our glorious Lord we see.
By our body's full redemption
Shall adoption be complete;
By the final transformation
All God's purpose we shall meet.

By that final transformation,
We'll be fully sanctified;
God will bring us into glory,
With His Son identified.
All creation is expecting
Sons of God revealed to be,
That they might be freed from bondage
Into glorious liberty.--------742
Man is a being of three parts,
The body, soul, and spirit too,
Th' eternal purpose to fulfill
With God's inheritance in view.

The body is the outward part
That man a world-sense may possess;
Thus he may touch the outward things
And bodily himself express.

The soul within  the inward part
Is but the very self of man;
The sense of self it gives to him
To touch the psychic world of man.

The spirit is the inmost part
With which the Lord he may receive;
The sense of God it gives to man
That he the spirit-world perceive.

Within the soul of man there are
The mind, emotion, and the will;
These are the functions for the man
His human nature to fulfill.

Within the spirit of the man
Are found the conscience, fellowship,
And intuition, which thereby
The man to worship God equip.

The man must exercise his soul
To choose that God he may possess,
And by his spirit God partake,
And thru his body God express.

Man's spirit had to be reborn
With life divine to him conveyed;
His soul must be transformed by God,
His body like Christ's body made.

'Tis by these steps of work divine
In each of man's three separate parts
That man is mingled with the Lord
And His expression full imparts.--------743
God created us His vessels
His expression to achieve;
Thus He made a heart to love Him
And a spirit to receive.

With our heart we have to love Him,
With our spirit Him possess
As our life, of Him partaking,
That Himself we may express.

Satan has our heart corrupted,
To our spirit death did give,
That the Lord we should not contact
But by self attempt to live.

Thus the Lord in His salvation
Heart and spirit has renewed
To recover our receiving
And our loving aptitude.

It is by our heart's renewal
We may God in love pursue,
And in newness of the spirit
We may contact God anew.

Ever true and pure and single
To the Lord our heart must be,
Poor in spirit, ever seeking
God to contact constantly.

Keep our heart, Lord, in love's freshness,
And our spirit strengthen more,
That in newness of the spirit
We may touch Thee o'er and o'er.--------744
In dealings with the Lord as life
We need a proper heart,
That of His riches, in His grace,
We fully may take part.

We need a heart in all things pure,
With mind both sound and clear,
To understand His mind and heart
In trembling and in fear.

We need a fervent, loving heart,
A heart on fire with love,
With an emotion filled with zeal
For Him, all else above.

We need a true, obedient heart,
With a submissive will,
A will made pliable, yet strong,
God's purpose to fulfill.

We need a heart condemning not,
In all things right with God;
A heart which has a conscience purged
And covered with the blood.

Lord, grant us such a heart as this,
Forever fixed on Thee,
That of Thyself we may partake
And Thy true fulness be.--------745
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
Who in our spirit lives;
One spirit have the two become,
Which oneness to us gives.

Thy Spirit with our spirit, Lord,
The witness ever bears
That we the Father's children are
And of God's glory heirs.

'Tis in our spirit Thee we touch
Thy riches to enjoy,
And as the Spirit Thou dost give
Thyself without alloy.

'Tis in our spirit we may walk
And follow Thee alway,
While, as the Spirit, Thou dost lead
And light impart each day.

In spirit, by Thy Spirit, Lord,
We live and worship Thee;
Thou, in our spirit, thru Thine own
Strengtheneth constantly.

In spirit, with Thy Spirit, Lord,
We offer prayer to Thee,
While, as the Spirit, Thou in us
Groanest unutterably.

We to our spirit would return
And there would contact Thine;
'Tis in the spirit we may share
Our heritage divine.

What oneness, O my Lord, is this
Two spirits intertwine!
Thy Spirit in our spirit lives,
And ours abides in Thine!--------746
Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
From soul that we Thyself may know;
Thou art the Spirit in our spirit,
In oneness mingled with us so.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
The soul-life ever to deny,
And ever follow Thee in spirit,
Thyself, the Spirit, to apply.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
That we may never set our mind
Upon the flesh but on the spirit,
That sin and self no more may bind.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
That we may never soulish be,
But truly spiritual, in spirit
To know all things discernibly.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
That subtle self exposed might be,
That by the cross to it applying
We'll live not by ourselves but Thee.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit
That we may be transformed in soul,
Till we're conformed to Thine own image,
Till we're matured and reach the goal.

Lord, teach us to discern the spirit,
To us Thy living Word so give
That soul from spirit be divided
And in the holiest place we'll live.--------747
The holiest of God's temple is
The inmost part; the mercy seat,
God's presence and the ark are there,
And there the priests the Lord may meet.

Now we're God's temple in three parts;
Our inmost part the spirit is;
There God and Christ as Spirit dwell,
The holiest place of holy 'tis.

'Tis here within our inmost part
That God in Christ is all to us;
'Tis here the Holy Spirit makes
The Lord reality to us.

'Tis here within the spirit-part
We contact Christ and dwell with Him;
'Tis by our spirit we with God
Have fellowship and worship Him.

'Tis here that Christ is like the land
Where we may dwell, its wealth enjoy;
'Tis here that we must fight the foe,
And Christ's authority employ.

The spirit we must seek to know,
Discerning spirit from the soul,
And live within this holiest place,
To worship God and reach His goal.

The soul we ever must forsake,
Press on, God's rest to enter in,
That Christ we may possess in full
And all God's plan fulfill therein.--------748
By the cross discern the spirit,
Put the soul to death alway;
Bear the cross, deny the self-life,
Walk in spirit day by day.

By the cross discern the spirit,
Through the living Word of God,
Separating soul from spirit,
That the right path may be trod.

By the cross discern the spirit,
With the mind by light renewed,
All emotion consecrated,
And the will in love subdued.

By the cross discern the spirit,
Passing thru the riven veil,
Flesh and soul are wholly broken,
And the spirit doth prevail.

By the cross discern the spirit,
'Tis the holiest place divine;
There commune with God in spirit
And His presence will be thine.

By the cross discern the spirit,
And the Jordan River cross;
Enter then the Land of Canaan,
And enjoy Christ thru the cross.

By the cross discern the spirit,
And within the spirit move;
As good land, on Christ e'er labor,
And His riches thou wilt prove.--------749
The Spirit of the triune God
Within our spirit now doth rest;
He ever seeks thru us to flow,
That God in Christ may be expressed.

But by the outward, natural man
The Spirit is confined within;
Instead of giving Him a home,
A prison we've become to Him.

He's like a treasure of great worth
Contained in vessels earthen-made;
The vessel must be broken through
And thus the treasure be displayed.

Oh, how the Lord our self must break,
Our outward man does so impede!
It must be broken thoroughly,
And thus the Spirit will be freed.

This is the reason why the Lord
For us a certain measure makes
Of circumstantial suffering;
'Tis thus our outward man He breaks.

The outward man, the self, the soul,
Must be consumed, must be decreased;
The inner man, our spirit, then
Shall with the Spirit be released.

Lord, grant Thy holy brokenness,
Deliver me from being whole;
And make me willing to receive
The wounds that Thou wouldst give my soul.

Oh, cause me to appreciate
Thy breaking, never to complain;
And grant that I may value more
All kinds of loss instead of gain.--------750
God's intention is to have us
All conformed to His dear Son;
Thus a work of transformation
By the Spirit must be done.

  Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
  Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
  All our being wholly fill.

God hath us regenerated
In our spirit with His life;
But He must transform us further
In our soul by His own life.

  Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
  Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
  All our being wholly fill.

Spreading outward from our spirit
Doth the Lord transform our soul,
By the inward parts renewing,
Till within His full control.

  Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
  Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
  All our being wholly fill.

By the power of His Spirit
In His pattern He transforms;
From His glory to His glory
To His image He conforms.

  Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
  Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
  All our being wholly fill.

He transforms, all sanctifying,
Till like Him we are matured;
He transforms, our soul possessing,
Till His stature is secured.

  Lord, transform us to Thine image
  In emotion, mind, and will;
  Saturate us with Thy Spirit,
  All our being wholly fill.--------751
It is not by struggling,
But by yielding all,
I may rest from labor,
All my burden fall.
It is not resolving,
But Thyself to heed,
I'm from sin delivered
And from bondage freed.

It is not by letter,
But by Spirit 'tis,
I will be approvd,
Share Thy life of bliss.
It is not man's teaching,
But anointing Thine,
Which imparts Thy light and
Fellowship divine.

It is not resolving
Now to run the race,
But 'tis by Thy mercy
I receive Thy grace.
It is not by knowledge,
But by grace alone,
I can pass thru suff'ring
To Thine image grown.

Not by lofty phrases,
But by power Thine,
I the lost can pilot
Unto life divine.
It is not my wisdom,
But Thy Spirit, Lord,
Which alone can fit me
To fulfill Thy Word.--------752
I am the Lord that healeth thee,
I am the Lord that healeth thee;
Jehovah-Rapha is My Name:
For I am the Lord that healeth thee.

I am the Lord that healeth thee,
I am the Lord that healeth thee;
Sickness must flee at My command:
For I am the Lord that healeth thee.

I am the Lord that healeth thee,
I am the Lord that healeth thee;
The prayer of faith shall banish disease:
For I am the Lord that healeth thee.

I am the Lord that healeth thee,
I am the Lord that healeth thee;
My Name is still as ointment poured forth:
For I am the Lord that healeth thee.

I am the Lord that healeth thee,
I am the Lord that healeth thee;
Come and be free from all your pains:
For I am the Lord that healeth thee.--------753
There is a healing branch that grows
Where every bitter Marah flows;
This is our health-renewing tree.
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."

There is an old appointed way
For those who hearken and obey;
Above the gate these words we see:
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."

There is an ordinance that has stood
Since Israel crossed the parted flood;
It stands today for you and me
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."

There is a great Physician still
Whose hand has all its ancient skill;
At His command our pains will flee
"I am the Lord that healeth thee."--------754
To those who fear Jehovah's name
How sweet the word the prophet brings:
The Sun of Righteousness shall rise
With healing in His wings.

It is to those that fear His name
His healing power the Savior brings;
Oh, let us hide with contrite hearts
Beneath His healing wings.

He is the Sun of Righteousness;
And while to sin our being clings
We cannot know His healing touch
Or rest beneath His wings.

It is His wings that heal our pains
And soothe the serpent's poisoned stings;
Close to His bosom we must press
To feel His healing wings.

Beneath those healing wings I rest,
While all my heart with rapture sings:
The Sun of Righteousness has risen
With healing in His wings.--------755
He healeth me, oh, bless His name!
I want to spread abroad His fame;
From dread disease He sets me free,
The Lord my healer, strong is He!

  He healeth me, He healeth me!
  By power divine He healeth me;
  He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!

He healeth me! My simple faith
Believes the word that Jesus saith,
And takes the place of ardent hope,
Believes the Lord will raise me up.

  He healeth me, He healeth me!
  By power divine He healeth me;
  He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!

He healeth me! I touch for cure
The border of His garment pure,
And virtue through my being flows,
A healing balm for nature's woes.

  He healeth me, He healeth me!
  By power divine He healeth me;
  He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!

He healeth me, as when of yore,
Their sins and sickness He bore;
Nor has He lost His power and skill
Our blessed Christ is living still.

  He healeth me, He healeth me!
  By power divine He healeth me;
  He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!

He healeth me! How oft I sought
This healing power, but found it not:
But now I trust with all my soul,
And now through faith He makes me whole.

  He healeth me, He healeth me!
  By power divine He healeth me;
  He healed the sick in Galilee,
  And now by faith He healeth me!--------756
When Christ of old with healing pow'r
When forth through all the suffering land,
His word so oft was wont to be,
"Stretch forth thy hand, stretch forth thy hand!"
And though the palsied arm might shrink
And tremble at the strange command,
The healing touch was only felt
While stretching forth the withered hand.

  O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
  Upon His promise take your stand.
  At His command stretch forth your hand,
  And Christ shall make you whole.

That changeless Christ is still as near
And just as kind and strong to save;
He came to lift our fallen race
From sin and sickness and the grave.
As in the days of Galilee,
Disease still flees at His command;
But ere His touch your frame can feel,
You, too, must still stretch forth your hand.

  O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
  Upon His promise take your stand.
  At His command stretch forth your hand,
  And Christ shall make you whole.

What though you feel so weak and faint?
He can your will with strength endue,
New faith and courage breathe within
And work in you to will and do.
Reach out to meet His quickening touch;
Take up your bed, arise and stand;
And pressing through to meet your Lord,
Stretch forth your hand, stretch forth your hand.

  O suffering one, stretch forth your hand,
  Upon His promise take your stand.
  At His command stretch forth your hand,
  And Christ shall make you whole.--------757
Red bold: vv. 4 and 5 may be omitted if hymn is sung for physical healing.

At even when the sun was set,
The sick, O Lord, around Thee lay;
O in what divers pains they met!
O with what joy they went away!

Once more 'tis eventide, and we
Oppressed with various ills draw near;
What if Thy form we cannot see?
We know and feel that Thou art here.

O Savior Christ, our woes dispel;
For some are sick, and some are sad,
And some have never love Thee well
And some have lost the love they had;

And some have found the world is vain,
Yet from the world they break not free;
And some have friends who give them pain,
Yet have not sought a friend in Thee;

And none, O Lord, have perfect rest,
For none are wholly free from sin;
And they who fain would serve Thee best
Are conscious most of wrong within.

O Savior Christ, Thou too art Man;
Thou hast been troubled, tempted, tried;
Thy kind but searching glance can scan
The very wounds that shame would hide.

Thy touch has still its ancient power;
No word from Thee can fruitless fall;
Hear in this solemn evening hour,
And in Thy mercy heal us all.--------758
Have you found the great Physician,
Jesus Christ of Galilee?
He who bore our pain and sorrow,
On the shameful, cruel tree?
Still He heals the sick and suff'ring,
As before He went away;
For His word most plainly tells us,
"He is just the same today."

  He is just the same today;
  As before He went away.
  Look to Him, believe and pray;
  Trust His word and then obey.
  "Praise God, He is just the same today."

Consecrate your life to Jesus,
Spirit, soul, and body too;
For "the Lord is for the body,"
Every pow'r He gave to you.
Let there be no reservation,
Give the Lord full right of way;
He will come and heal His temple,
For He is the same today.

  He is just the same today;
  As before He went away.
  Look to Him, believe and pray;
  Trust His word and then obey.
  "Praise God, He is just the same today."

Do you doubt God's will to heal you?
Take His word and ask for light;
If you seek in deep contrition,
He will guide your heart aright.
Do you fear to claim His promise,
He will not your trust betray;
When on earth He gladly healed them,
And He is the same today.

  He is just the same today;
  As before He went away.
  Look to Him, believe and pray;
  Trust His word and then obey.
  "Praise God, He is just the same today."

Oh! I'm glad to tell you, suff'rer,
Christ has more than healing too;
Life abundant overflowing,
He will gladly give to you.
Step out boldly, claim His fulness,
Let your sadness flee away;
When on earth He made them joyful,
And He is the same today.

  He is just the same today;
  As before He went away.
  Look to Him, believe and pray;
  Trust His word and then obey.
  "Praise God, He is just the same today."--------759
Just one touch as He moves along,
Pushed and pressed by the jostling throng,
Just one touch and the weak was strong,
Cured by the Healer divine.

  Just one touch as He passes by,
  He will list to the faintest cry.
  Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
  Christ is the Healer divine.

Just one touch! And He makes me whole,
Speaks sweet peace to my sin-sick soul,
At His feet all my burdens roll,
Cured by the Healer divine.

  Just one touch as He passes by,
  He will list to the faintest cry.
  Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
  Christ is the Healer divine.

Just one touch! And the work is done,
I am cured by the blessed Son,
I will sing while the ages run,
Cured by the Healer divine.

  Just one touch as He passes by,
  He will list to the faintest cry.
  Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
  Christ is the Healer divine.

Just one touch! And He turns to me,
O the love in His eyes I see!
I am His for He hears my plea,
Cured by the Healer divine.

  Just one touch as He passes by,
  He will list to the faintest cry.
  Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
  Christ is the Healer divine.

Just one touch! By His mighty power
He can heal thee this very hour,
Thou canst hear though the tempests low'r,
Cured by the Healer divine.

  Just one touch as He passes by,
  He will list to the faintest cry.
  Come and be cured while the Lord is nigh,
  Christ is the Healer divine.--------760
She only touched the hem of His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
And straightway she was whole.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His healing pow'r this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!

She came in fear and trembling before Him,
She knew her Lord had come,
She felt that from Him virtue had healed her,
The mighty deed was done.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His healing pow'r this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!

He turned with "Daughter, be of good comfort,
Thy faith hath made thee whole";
And peace that passeth all understanding
With gladness filled her soul.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment,
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His healing pow'r this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!--------761
Prayer is the soul's sincere desire,
Uttered, or unexpressed;
The motion of a hidden fire
That trembles in the breast.

Prayer is the burden of a sigh,
The falling of a tear;
The upward glancing of an eye
When none but God is near.

Prayer is the simplest form of speech
That infant lips can try;
Prayer the sublimest strains that reach
The Majesty on high.

Prayer is the Christian's vital breath,
The Christian's native air;
His watchword at the gates of death;
He enters rest with prayer.

The saints in prayer appear as one,
In word, and deed, and mind;
While with the Father and the Son
Sweet fellowship they find.

O Thou, by whom we come to God,
The Life, the Truth, the Way,
The path of prayer Thyself hast trod
Lord, teach us how to pray.--------762
Prayer is the incense of a holy heart
Rising to God from bruised and broken things,
When kindled by the Spirit's burning breath
And upward borne by faith's ascending wings.

Prayer is the perfume of the plants of grace,
The flowers of patience, faith, and suffering love;
Treasured in "vials full of odors sweet,"
God breathes their fragrance in His courts above.

Prayer is th' ascending vapor which supplies
The showers of blessing, and the stream that flows
Through earth's dry places, till on every side
"The wilderness shall blossom as the rose."

Prayer is the heavenly telephone that brings
The distant near, till heaven to earth comes down,
And in our Father's ear and heart we may
Our burdens tell and all our sorrows drown.

Prayer is the wireless telegraph that sends
Its heart throbs on the ether waves of heaven;
It finds the heart of God, and back to earth
The answering thrill to faith and love are given.

Prayer is the golden pipes the Spirit fills,
Which feed the lamps of God with oil divine,
And, as with one accord we wait and pray,
The Spirit fills, the lamps with brightness shine.

Prayer is the mightiest force of earth and heaven,
Prayer is the very dynamite of God;
It moves the hand that all things moves, and turns
The living wheels that sweep through earth abroad.

Teach us to pray! Move on our hearts, O Lord,
Till Thine own passion all our being move!
Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be
Christ in us praying to the Christ above!

Teach us to pray! Reveal Thy will to us,
Till Thine own purpose all our being move!
Teach us! Pray in us, till our prayer shall be
God in us answering to the God above!--------763
Christ is the Alpha of our prayers;
We know not how to pray
Save as His Spirit in our hearts
Shall teach us what to say.

Christ is the Omega of our prayer,
The Father's great Amen
That rounds our halting periods
To sense beyond our ken.

But in the little space between
He lets us make the links,
And with our slow and stammering speech
Interpret what He thinks.

O First and Last, take Thou the prayers
Of every trusting soul,
And weld them to Thine own desire
To make a perfect whole.

Thou great Beginning of that Word
We cannot speak or spell,
Of the short syllable we lisp
Be Thou the End as well!--------764
Lord, in Thy presence silent I would be,
That in the inmost I to Thee may come;
I would not in my own way pray to Thee,
But let Thy prayer in me my prayer become.

It seems Thou art in heaven hearing me,
But right within my spirit Thou dost dwell;
It seems that I am praying unto Thee,
But really from Thyself the prayers do well.

When, Lord, no words my burden can express,
My spirit with Thy Spirit deeply groans;
Not verbally I then my plea address,
But Thou dost pray within with words unknown.

I would inhale Thee, Lord, e'en as I breathe,
And eat and drink Thee as my life supply.
A deeper fellowship with Thee bequeath
That Thou express Thyself through me thereby.

Here in this fellowship Thy light doth shine,
Thy precious blood doth cleanse and make me clean;
May I not only, Lord, Thy light enshrine,
But may Thou be expressed and clearly seen.

Thy oil anoints me here in every way,
Anointing Thee within unceasingly;
I more decrease, Thou more increase each day,
Thus full expression Thou shalt have through me.

Myself I open that Thou may flow in;
Op'ning myself to others, Lord, flow out;
By such a stream, the fellowship within,
Thou, Lord, expressed will be my life throughout.--------765
Christian, seek not yet repose,
Hear thy gracious Savior say;
Thou are in the midst of foes:
Watch and pray.

Principalities and powers,
Mustering their unseen array,
Wait for thy unguarded hours:
Watch and pray.

Gird thy heavenly armor on,
Wear it ever night and day;
Ambushed lies the evil one:
Watch and pray.

Hear the victors who o'ercame,
Still they mark each warrior's way;
All with one sweet voice exclaim,
Watch and pray.

Hear, above all, hear thy Lord,
Him thou lovest to obey;
Hide within thy heart His word:
Watch and pray.

Watch, as if on that alone
Hung the issue of the day;
Pray, that help may be sent down:
Watch and pray.--------766
Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;
This is my heart-cry day unto day;
I long to know Thy will and Thy way;
Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray.

  Living in Thee, Lord, and Thou in me,
  Constant abiding, this is my plea;
  Grant me Thy power, boundless and free,
  Power with men and power with Thee.

Power in prayer, Lord, power in prayer!
Here 'mid earth's sin and sorrow and care,
Men lost and dying, souls in despair;
O give me power, power in prayer!

  Living in Thee, Lord, and Thou in me,
  Constant abiding, this is my plea;
  Grant me Thy power, boundless and free,
  Power with men and power with Thee.

My weakened will, Lord, Thou canst renew;
My sinful nature Thou canst subdue;
Fill me just not with power anew;
Power to pray and power to do!

  Living in Thee, Lord, and Thou in me,
  Constant abiding, this is my plea;
  Grant me Thy power, boundless and free,
  Power with men and power with Thee.

Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray;
Thou art my pattern day unto day;
Thou art my surety, now and for aye;
Teach me to pray, Lord, teach me to pray.

  Living in Thee, Lord, and Thou in me,
  Constant abiding, this is my plea;
  Grant me Thy power, boundless and free,
  Power with men and power with Thee.--------767
Teach us to pray that we may cause
The enemy to flee,
That we his evil pow'r may bind,
His prisoners to free.

Teach us to pray and firmly stand
Upon the battleground,
To fight and break the stronghold down,
The enemy confound.

Teach us to pray and use Thy rod
In strong, prevailing prayer,
Beneath Thy blood to shake the earth
And powers of the air.

By prayer and faith, O may we learn
To labor, Lord, with Thee,
To know the victory is ours
And Thine authority.--------768
Lord, teach us to use
The intercessor's rod,
As Moses did of old
Upon the hill of God.

Before the upstayed arm
The ranks of darkness quailed!
In great Jehovah's Name
The hosts of light prevailed!

Teach us to bind the foe
With iron chains of prayer,
That all Thy Church may move
To victory everywhere.

Give us the steady arm,
Until the sun go down,
That we in Christ may win
The overcomer's crown.--------769
To the holiest place I'd come,
There within the veil to be;
There to touch the throne of grace,
Let life's water flow thru me.

Now the holiest place of all
Right within my spirit is;
Here the Lord in me abides,
And my spirit joins with His.

To my spirit I'd return,
For 'tis here the Lord I'll meet;
O how marvellous it is!
He's within, in me complete.

Fragrance of the risen Christ
Thru my spirit may be spread;
If in spirit I will pray
Christ will be exhibited.

If in spirit Him I touch,
With His riches filled I'll be;
Life and light and love and grace
As a stream will flow thru me.

Touching deeply, richly I
Of Himself experience,
Thus the law of life I touch
And His clear anointing sense.

In my spirit deeper still
I would touch the Lord I love,
Touch Him in His hidden depth
And His hidden manna prove.

When the resurrection life
Is made real in pow'r to me,
As the rod with sprouting buds,
I will then accepted be.

Here I find the throne of grace,
Where the living water flows
As a river full of grace
Into me grace to bestow.

10 Then whene'er we meet to pray,
All our spirits we'll release;
Mingled will our spirits be,
And we'll serve the Lord as priests.

11 This the holiest place is too,
Where we all may touch the Lord,
Touch His throne in many ways
Till His grace on us is poured.--------770
In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace,
Grace as a river shall flow;
In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace,
Grace as a river shall flow.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Grace as a river shall flow;
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Grace as a river shall flow.

In the holiest place, live before His face,
Light of glory thru me will shine;
In the holiest place, live before His face,
Light of glory thru me will shine.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Light of glory thru me will shine;
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Light of glory thru me will shine.

To the spirit turn, and the incense burn,
Touch the living fountain of life;
To the spirit turn, and the incense burn,
Touch the living fountain of life.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Touch the living fountain of life;
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Touch the living fountain of life.--------771
The veil is rent and opened is
A new and living way;
With boldness thru the precious blood,
We come to Thee to pray.

By Thy redemption we may come
Into the holiest place;
Thy Spirit now anointing us,
We touch the throne of grace.

In spirit only we would pray,
Ourselves by Thee possessed,
That from our spirit Christ the Lord
As incense be expressed.

Thy grace and mercy as a stream
From out the throne does flow,
Refreshing in the hour of need
How rich, how sweet to know!

Though for our needs we do not ask
But by Thy Spirit pray,
Our every need is known to Thee,
We're in Thy care alway.

Though griefs and trials on us press,
We will not anxious be,
But all our care upon Thee cast
And set our spirit free.

O may I concentrated be
In fellowship with Thee,
My prayer and incense offering,
Thy Spirit leading me.--------772
Lord, we meet to seek Thy face
And in one accord to pray;
We a holy priesthood are,
Waiting on Thee here today.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

As true priests we long to be,
With our spirit sense Thy will,
Thus to serve before Thee here
That Thy plan Thou may fulfill.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

To the holiest place we come,
Now to touch Thy throne of grace,
By the inner sense to pray
And Thy Spirit's flow to trace.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

From Thy throne of grace to me
Rivers of Thy grace proceed;
Thus my spirit is refreshed,
Helping me in time of need.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

May our prayers expression give
To Thy Spirit's mind alone;
Praying not by our desire,
But according to Thine own.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

Though with temporal matters pressed,
Which we fain would bring to Thee,
Rather than Thy care to seek,
We would here Thy channel be.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.

Here we seek Thy list'ning ear,
May Thy living water flow;
When Thy grace does satisfy,
Only then Thy work we'll know.

  Here together we would pray,
  Touch the highest and the best,
  Till our spirits mingled are
  And Thy Church is built and blest.--------773
Lord Jesus Christ, we seek Thy face;
Within the veil we bow the knee;
Oh, let Thy glory fill the place,
And bless us while we wait on Thee.

We thank Thee for the precious blood
That purged our sins and brought us nigh;
All cleansed and sanctified to God,
Thy holy name to magnify.

Shut in with Thee far, far above
The restless world that wars below;
We seek to learn and prove Thy love,
Thy wisdom and Thy grace to know.

The brow that once with thorns was bound,
Thy hands, Thy side, we fain would see;
Draw near, Lord Jesus, glory crowned,
And bless us while we wait on Thee.--------774
From every stormy wind that blows,
From every swelling tide of woes,
There is a calm, a sure retreat
'Tis found beneath the mercy seat.

There is a place where Jesus sheds
The oil of gladness on our heads,
A place than all besides more sweet
It is the blood-bought mercy seat.

There is a scene where spirits blend,
Where friend holds fellowship with friend;
Though sundered far, by faith they meet
Around one common mercy seat.

There, there on eagle's wings we soar,
And time and sense seem all no more,
And heaven comes down our souls to greet,
And glory crowns the mercy seat.--------775
In the mighty Name of Jesus,
When we bow before the throne,
Many deadly foes are vanquished,
Many victories are won.

  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  In that Name alone we win.
  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  Conquering Satan, death and sin.

When we plead the Name of Jesus,
Satan and His hosts must flee.
Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!
In Thy Name is victory.

  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  In that Name alone we win.
  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  Conquering Satan, death and sin.

Soon shall come the blessed moment
When the battle shall be won,
When the Mighty Name of Jesus
Shall exalt us to the throne.

  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  In that Name alone we win.
  Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
  Conquering Satan, death and sin.--------776
"Ask in faith," the Name of Jesus
All your plea before the throne;
As you trust, the Lord will whisper,
"See, my child, the work is done."

"Ask in faith," God waits to answer
Each petition, Spirit-wrought;
He will work in wondrous power,
Far beyond your highest thought.

"Ask in faith," 'tis just the asking,
In a faith that dares to stand,
Full of joyful expectation,
With an open, outstretched hand.

"Ask in faith," for God is waiting
For thy faith-filled, earnest prayer.
Faith delights Him; faith can touch Him,
Every moment, everywhere.--------777
Say to this mountain, "Go,
Be cast into the sea!"
And doubt not in thine heart
That it shall be to thee.
It shall be done, doubt not His Word,
Command thy mountain in the Lord!

Claim thy redemption right,
Purchased by precious blood;
The Trinity unite
To make it true and good.
It shall be done, obey the Word,
Command thy mountain in the Lord!

Self, sickness, sorrow, sin,
The Lord did meet that day
One His beloved One,
And thou art "loosed away."
It shall be done, rest on His Word!
Command thy mountain in the Lord!

Compass the frowning wall
With silent prayer, then raise
Before its ramparts fall
The victor's shout of praise.
It shall be done, faith rests assured,
Command thy mountain in the Lord!

The two-leaved gates of brass,
The bars of iron yield,
To let the faithful pass,
Conquerors in every field.
It shall be done, the foe ignored,
Command thy mountain in the Lord!

Take then the faith of God,
Free from the taint of doubt;
The wonder-working rod
That casts all reasoning out.
It shall be done, stand on the Word.
Command thy mountain in the Lord!--------778
  Repeat the last line of each verse

Keep up the song of faith,
However dark the night;
And as you praise, the Lord will work
To change your faith to sight.

Keep up the song of faith,
And let your heart be strong,
For God delights when faith can praise
Though dark the night and long.

Keep up the song of faith,
The foe will hear and flee;
Oh, let not Satan hush your song,
For praise is victory.

Keep up the song of faith,
The dawn will break ere long,
And we shall go to meet the Lord,
And join the endless song.--------779

Exercise the spirit,
Pray in every way!
I have prayed too little,
Keen my spirit, nay.
Even when I prayed, my
Spirit seldom proved
Ever just to follow
As Thy Spirit moved.

Now I'd pray in spirit
As Thy Spirit groans;
Pray by the anointing,
Not as memory owns.
Not the mind applying,
But with spirit pray,
Praising or beseeching,
Spirit-led alway.

Not just by myself my
Spirit exercise,
But with others praying
I would do likewise;
Praying in the spirit,
As the spirit wants,
For 'tis in the inmost
Spirits have response.

When we serve together,
We thru prayer would move,
Fellowship in spirit,
Not in word to prove.
Never pray together,
Shouting, crying much,
Yet the fellowship in
Spirit never touch.

Exercise the spirit
Here and everywhere,
Few or many present,
Caring not who's there.
Not a place or person
Will influence me,
In all kinds of meetings
I'll my spirit free.

Thus my spirit lifted
Gives the Lord His way;
Thus, my spirit strengthened,
I'll be used each day.
In the spirit's flowing
Living water see;
Thus the saints are mingled,
Built the church will be.--------782
How mysterious, O Lord,
That Thy Spirit dwells in mine;
O how marvelous it is,
Into one, two spirits twine.

By the spirit I can walk,
Spiritual in spirit be;
By the spirit I can serve,
And in spirit worship Thee.

Thru Thy Word and by my prayer
In the spirit touching Thee,
Lifted high my spirit is,
Strengthened shall my spirit be.

Make my spirit strong I pray
Others' spirits to revive;
Lift my spirit high and free,
Others' spirits then may thrive.

Every time I speak, O Lord,
May my spirit actuate;
And whatever I may do,
Let my spirit motivate.

Every time my spirit acts
Others' spirits opened be,
Every time my spirit moves
Others' lifted unto Thee.

Lord, have mercy, from above
May Thy Spirit breathe on me;
Then my spirit will be rich,
Strengthened and refreshed by Thee.--------783

When thou wakest in the morning
Ere thou tread'st the untried way
Of the lot that lies before thee
Through the coming busy day;
Whether sunbeams promise brightness,
Whether dim forebodings fall,
Be thy dawning glad or gloomy,
Go to Jesus, tell Him all.

In the calm of sweet communion
Let thy daily work be done;
In the peace of soul-outpouring
Care be banished, patience won;
And if earth with its enchantments
Seek thy spirit to enthrall,
Ere thou listen, ere thou answer,
Turn to Jesus, tell Him all.

Then, as hour by hour glides by thee,
Thou wilt blessed guidance know,
Thine own burdens being lightened,
Thou canst bear another's woe;
Thou canst help the weak ones onward,
Thou canst raise up those that fall:
But remember, while thou servest,
Still tell Jesus, tell Him all.

And if weariness creeps o'er thee
As the day wears to its close,
Or if sudden fierce temptation
Bring thee face to face with foes;
In thy weakness, in thy peril,
Raise to heaven a truthful call;
Strength and calm for every crisis
Come, in telling Jesus all.--------789
What a Friend we have in Jesus,
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
In His arms He'll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.--------790
"Keep the incense burning"
On the altar fire;
Let thy heart's petition,
Let thy deep desire,
Be a cloud of incense
Wreathing God's own throne,
Till His will among us
Shall be fully done.

"Keep the incense burning"
On the altar fire;
Feed the flame, Lord Jesus,
Till Thy whole desire
Shall in us, Thy children,
Find free course, and be
Breathed through lips anointed
For this ministry.

"Keep the incense burning"
Though the faith be weak;
Though in words thou canst not
All thy longings speak;
Silent heart-petitions,
Spirit-taught, will be
Gloriously answered;
Wrought by God for thee.

"Keep the incense burning,"
Hourly let it rise,
Till from opened heavens,
Till from flame-swept skies,
Fire shall fall and kindle
All hearts to a flame;
Making us a glory
To our Savior's name.--------791

Beholds His beauty, incense burns
Of prayer before the Lord.

  Let us the incense burn
  Of prayer before the Lord;

  Our praise to Him outpoured.

The lamp he too must light.

But constant praises bring.

And I'll rejoice with Him.

His holy light illum'ning me
To others I'll transmit.

First let Him speak to thee, then speak to Him;
True prayer in thee the Lord initiates,

Learn to let God anoint thee with Himself
And thru thy prayer His purposes fulfill.

Silent to all thy earthly cares and calls,

Till thru the spirit God possesses all
And thus transforms each part unto His Son.

Till all thy words and actions hour by hour
Are the fulfillment of God's will thru thee.--------794
Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, I care not how,
But stir my heart in passion for the world,
Stir me to give, to go, but most to pray;
Stir till the blood-red banner be unfurled
O'er lands that still in heathen darkness lie,
O'er deserts where no cross is lifted high.

Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till all my heart
Is filled with strong compassion for these souls;
Till Thy compelling word drives me to pray;
Till Thy constraining love reach to the poles
Far north and south, in burning deep desire,
Till east and west are caught in love's great fire.

Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, till prayer is pain,
Till prayer is joy, till prayer turns into praise;
Stir me, till heart and will and mind, yea, all
Is wholly Thine to use through all the days.
Stir, till I learn to pray exceedingly;
Stir, till I learn to wait expectantly.

Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, Thy heart was stirred
By love's intensest fire, till Thou didst give
Thine only Son, Thy best beloved One,
E'en to the dreadful cross, that I might live.
Stir me to give myself so back to Thee,
That Thou canst give Thyself again through me.

Stir me, oh, stir me, Lord, for I can see
Thy glorious triumph-day begin to break;
The dawn already gilds the eastern sky;
Oh, Church of Christ, arise, awake, awake.
Oh! stir us, Lord, as heralds of that day.
For night is past, our King is on His way.--------795
Father, let Thy kingdom come,
Let it come with living power;
Speak at length the final word,
Usher in the triumph hour.

As it came in days of old,
In the deepest hearts of men,
When Thy martyrs died for Thee,
Let it come, O God, again.

Tyrant thrones and idol shrines,
Let them from their place be hurled;
Enter on Thy better reign,
Wear the crown of this poor world.

Oh, what long, sad years have gone,
Since Thy Church was taught this prayer;
Oh, what eyes have watched and wept
For the dawning everywhere.

Break, triumphant day of God!
Break at last our hearts to cheer;
Throbbing souls and holy songs
Wait to hail Thy dawning here.

Empires, temples, scepters, thrones,
May they all for God be won;
And, in every human heart,
Father, let Thy kingdom come.--------796
Christ, from whom all blessings flow,
Perfecting the saints below,
Hear us, who Thy nature share,
Who Thy mystic body are.

Join us, in one spirit join,
Let us still receive of Thine;
Still for more on Thee we call,
Thou who fillest all in all.

Move, and actuate, and guide:
Divers gifts to each divide;
Placed according to Thy will,
Let us all our work fulfill.

Sweetly may we all agree,
Touched with loving sympathy;
Kindly for each other care,
Every member feel its share.

Love, like death, hath all destroyed,
Rendered all distinctions void;
Name, and sects, and parties fall:
Thou, O Christ, art all in all.--------797

All Scripture is the very breath of God,
And by His Spirit into words was breathed;
By godly men the words were written down,
With all God's fulness unto man bequeathed.

It is the breath of God as light to man,
With rays divine man to illuminate;
It shines in darkness and to man reveals
What is his truest need and actual state.

It is the breath of God as life to man,
Nature divine to man it doth impart;
The dead it quickens and regenerates,
Transforms the soul-life and renews the heart.

It is the breath of God as wisdom too,
Knowledge divine to man it has to teach;
Th' eternal purpose of the Lord it shows,
And leadeth man God's final goal to reach.

It is the breath of God as strength to man,
Power divine to man it doth transmit,
Strength'ning the weak, empowering the faint,
Enabling man God's purpose full to fit.

It is the breath of God for us to breathe,
That as our portion God we may enjoy;
Receiving it by spirits exercised,
Our need is met, His wealth we may employ.--------800
God the Lord has spoken, God has been unveiled;
All His character and persons are expressed;
Unto Adam's sons His mystery is revealed,
Fully illustrated and made manifest.

God the Lord has spoken, and His heart disclosed,
That His Son should have pre-eminence in all,
That in His dear Son He might be glorified
Midst all His creation, either great or small.

God the Lord has spoken, Christ has been revealed:
He is very God and yet is truly man;
He is all in all, in Him all things subsist,
Center and circumference of th' eternal plan.

God the Lord has spoken, and His mystery shown,
Christ and His expression has His counsel willed:
Christ with all God's fulness as the glorious Head,
And the Church His Body, with His riches filled.

God the Lord has spoken, and from heaven shown
That the triune God would blend with creature-man:
Father in the Son, the Son the Spirit is,
Dwelling in the Body to fulfill His plan.

God the Lord has spoken, revelation giv'n
Of His vast creation and His lowly birth,
Of His great redemption and salvation full;
May His adoration ever fill the earth.--------801
O living Word of God, God's image true,
Thou art the content of God's written word;
God in Thee we have met, God's fulness found.
And in the Scripture we Thyself have heard.

No man has e'er seen God, apart from Thee,
Without the Scripture Thee we'd hardly see;
Thou to the human race God hast declared,
And thru the Scripture Thou art shown to me.

Perfect embodiment Thou art of God,
A portrait full the Scripture gives of Thee;
In Thee we comprehend God's image true,
And thru the Scripture Thou art real to me.

Life-giving Spirit Thou, as well as Word,
Now e'en the Spirit in the Word Thou art;
When thru the Spirit giv'n, I touch the Word,
Fulness divine to me Thou dost impart.

In Thee I may with God have fellowship,
And thru the Scripture I on Thee may feed;
Thru study of the Word with prayer to God
Thy glorious riches fully meet my need.

Teach me to exercise my spirit, Lord,
Thy Word to study, so to contact Thee,
That Thou, the living Word, with Scripture, too,
As one my daily manna e'er may be.--------802
Thou art the Word and Spirit, Lord;
Now in one spirit worship we;
'Tis by the Word we understand,
And in the Spirit contact Thee.

Since Thou with me has joined in one,
Thou art my all, O Lord, thereby;
And as the Spirit and the Word
Thou cam'st to me as my supply.

If Thou art Lord, yet not the Word,
How couldest Thou be know to me?
If Thou art God yet Spirit not,
How could I ever contact Thee?

The Word reveals Thyself to me
And knowledge of Thyself imparts;
The Spirit is Thy substance true
Whereby I touch Thee as Thou art.

Thou art my life, my light, my way,
My food, my strength and guaranty;
By Word made known, as Spirit these
Become experience to me.

The Word in Scripture is expressed,
Thy Spirit, the Indwelling One;
Thy Word is spirit and is life
When to my spirit it doth come.

If I Thy Word would understand,
I must Thy Holy Spirit touch;
Not only grasp it with my mind,
But with my spirit, praying much.

Thy precious Word my heart doth love,
My spirit fellowships with Thine;
My heart rejoices in Thy Word,
My spirit praises sings in Thine.--------803
O Word of God incarnate,
O Wisdom from on high,
O Truth unchanged, unchanging,
O Light of our dark sky,
We praise Thee for the radiance
That from the hallowed page,
A lantern to the footsteps,
Shines on from age to age.

The Church from her dear Master
Received the gift divine,
And still that light she lifteth
O'er all the earth to shine:
It is the golden treasure
Where gems of truth are stored;
It is the heaven-drawn picture
Of Christ, the living Word.

It floateth like a banner
Before God's host unfurled;
It shineth like a beacon
Above the darkling world;
It is the chart and compass
That, o'er life's surging sea,
'Mid mists and rocks and quicksands
Still guide, O Christ, to Thee.

O make Thy Church, dear Savior,
A lampstand of pure gold,
To bear before the nations
Thy light, that all behold;
O teach Thy wandering pilgrims
By this their path to trace,
Till, clouds and darkness ended,
They see Thee face to face.--------804
Thy Word is like a storehouse, Lord,
With full provision there,
And everyone who seeks may come,
Its glorious wealth to share.
Thy Word is like a deep, deep mine,
And jewels rich and rare
Are hidden in its mighty depths
For every searcher there.

Thy Word is like a starry host:
A thousand rays of light
Are seen to guide the traveler,
And make his pathway bright.
Thy Word is like an armory,
Where soldiers may repair,
And find, for life's long battle day,
All needful weapons there.

O may I love Thy precious Word,
May I explore the mine,
May I its glorious riches take,
May light upon me shine.
O may I find my armor there,
Thy Word my trusty sword;
I'll learn to fight with every foe
The battle of the Lord.

Word of the ever living God,
Will of His glorious Son;
Without Thee how could earth be trod,
Or God and Christ be won?
Lord, grant us all aright to learn
The wisdom it imparts,
And to its heav'nly teaching turn,
With simple, child-like hearts.--------805
Oh, how I love this blessed Book!
The story of redeeming grace,
Love letter of my Bridegroom's heart
And mirror of my Savior's face.

Oh, how I love this blessed Book!
My checkbook on the bank above,
Deed of my heavenly heritage
And dying will of Him I love.

Oh, how I love this blessed Book!
Bright telescope through which I view
The wonders of the world to come
And gaze on glories ever new.

Oh, how I love this blessed Book!
My Guide Book all my earthly way,
The lamp that cheers my darkest night,
The sunshine of my brightest day.--------806
Break Thou the Bread of Life,
Dear Lord, to me,
As Thou didst break the loaves
Beside the sea;
Beyond the sacred page
I seek Thee, Lord;
My spirit pants for Thee,
O Living Word.

Thou art the Bread of Life,
O Lord, to me,
Thy holy Word the truth
That saveth me;
Give me to eat and live
With Thee above;
Teach me to love Thy truth,
For Thou art Love.

Oh, send Thy Spirit, Lord,
Now unto me,
That He may touch my eyes,
And make me see;
Show me the truth concealed
Within Thy Word,
And in Thy Book revealed
I see the Lord.

Bless Thou the truth, dear Lord,
To me, to me,
As Thou didst bless the bread
By Galilee;
Then shall all bondage cease,
All fetters fall,
And I shall find my peace,
My All in all.--------807
Open my eyes that I may see
Glimpses of truth Thou hast for me;
Place in my hands the wonderful key
That shall unclasp and set me free.

  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my eyes, illumine me,
  Spirit Divine!

Open my ears that I may hear
Voices of truth Thou sendest clear;
And while the wave notes fall on my ear,
Everything false will disappear.

  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my eyes, illumine me,
  Spirit Divine!

Open my mouth and let me bear
Tidings of mercy everywhere;
Open my heart and let me prepare
Love with Thy children thus to share.

  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my eyes, illumine me,
  Spirit Divine!

Open my mind that I may read
More of Thy love in word and deed;
What shall I fear while yet Thou dost lead?
Only for light from Thee I plead.

  Silently now I wait for Thee,
  Ready, my God, Thy will to see;
  Open my eyes, illumine me,
  Spirit Divine!--------808
Master, speak! Thy servant heareth,
Waiting for Thy gracious word,
Longing for Thy voice that cheereth,
Master, let it now be heard.
I am list'ning, Lord, for Thee;
What hast Thou to say to me?

Often through my heart is pealing
Many another voice than Thine,
Many an unwilled echo stealing
From the walls of this Thy shrine.
Let Thy longed-for accents fall;
Master, speak! and silence all.

Master speak! though least and lowest,
Let me not unheard depart;
Master, speak! for oh, Thou knowest
All the yearning of my heart.
Knowest all its truest need;
Speak! and make me blest indeed.

Master speak! and make me ready,
When Thy voice is truly heard,
With obedience glad and steady,
Still to follow every word,
I am listening, Lord, for Thee:
Master, speak, oh, speak to me!

Speak to me by name, O Master,
Let me know it is to me;
Speak, that I may follow faster,
With a step more firm and free,
Where the Shepherd leads the flock,
In the shadow of the Rock!--------809
Speak, Lord, in the stillness,
While I wait on Thee;
Hushed my heart to listen,
In expectancy.

Speak, O blessed Master,
In this quiet hour;
Let me see Thy face, Lord,
Feel Thy touch of power.

For the words Thou speakest,
They are life indeed;
Living bread from heaven,
Now my spirit feed!

All to Thee is yielded,
I am not my own;
Blissful, glad surrender,
I am Thine alone.

Speak, Thy servant heareth,
Be not silent, Lord;
Waits my soul upon Thee
For the quickening word.

Fill me with the knowledge
Of Thy glorious will;
All Thine own good pleasure
In Thy child fulfill.

Like a watered garden,
Full of fragrance rare,
Lingering in Thy presence,
Let my life appear.--------810
Lord, hast Thou not one word for me
To bind my soul more close to Thee,
That every evil I may flee;
One word, O Lord! one word from Thee?

One word, to show how weak am I
When in my strength alone I try,
In vain I toil, in vain I sigh;
One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.

One word, to show how near Thou art,
For Thou dost dwell within my heart;
And of Thy life I share a part;
One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.

One word of power, oh, let me hear,
Above the heart's most anxious fear,
Thy still, small voice, yet deep and clear;
One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.

One word of final triumph, Lord;
Sweet hope Thy promises afford,
To dwell with Thee in sweet accord;
One word, O Lord! one word from Thee.--------811
My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;
I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;
All that I need is none other but Thee,
Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Thou art the food and the water of life,
Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;
I long to eat and to drink here of Thee,
Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Thou art the Word with God's fulness in Thee,
Thou too the Spirit that God my life be;
Thee in the Word I enjoy as my food,
Thou as the Spirit art water to me.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Thou from the heavens as food camest down,
Thou to be drink hast been smitten for me;
Thou as the food, my exhaustless supply,
Thou as the water, a stream unto me.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Thou in the Word art the Spirit and life,
Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;
Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live,
Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,
On Thee to feed till my hunger is o'er.
Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,
Of Thee to drink till I'm thirsty no more.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,
Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;
Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,
Praying and reading  Lord, Thou art my fare.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;
Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;
May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me
As man hath never enjoyed nor e'er heard.

  Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
  Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
  Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.--------812
I come to Thee, dear Lord,
My heart doth thirst for Thee;
Of Thee I'd eat, of Thee I'd drink,
Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

Just to behold Thy face,
For this my heart doth cry;
I deeply long to drink of Thee
My thirst to satisfy.

Thy glorious, radiant face
My heart delights to see;
Here I'd abide and ne'er depart,
Beholding constantly.

In such a fellowship
Thou, Lord, art grace to me;
My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,
I enter rest in Thee.

Lord, I would linger here,
Still seeking after Thee,
Continue in the Word and prayer
Till Thou dost flow thru me.--------813
I come before Thy throne of grace
With hungry heart on Thee to feed,
Thy grace and mercy to receive
To help me in this hour of need.

Here I behold Thy radiant face,
Its light upon my heart doth shine
With healing rays consuming all
The weaknesses and faults of mine.

'Tis here Thy light illuminates
My true condition unto me;
'Tis here Thy blood's effectiveness
To cleanse from sin I gladly see.

Thy Spirit too anoints me here
And makes Thy very substance mine;
Thy very self I thus enjoy
And know Thy very heart's design.

Thy Word I read before Thee here
E'en as the priests the lamp did light;
Thy Spirit is as oil to me
To light Thy Word and give me sight.

E'en as the priests the incense burned,
In prayer to Thee I persevere;
As incense Thou the Spirit art
Mixed with the prayer I offer here.

Thy Word is light, Thy Word is food;
Which doth enlighten and supply;
I long to read and feed much more,
For light and food to satisfy.

Thou art the living water too
Which full revival doth bestow;
I wish to pray and drink e'en more
That through me living rivers flow.

Thou art the incense unto God,
In Thee acceptance is complete;
I want to pray yet more and more,
To offer up this fragrance sweet.

10 By reading I'm enlightened, filled,
By prayer my thirst is quenched indeed;
Thus Thou to me may be supplied,
And Thou through me may meet the need.

11 I long to have such fellowship,
To read and pray and blend with Thee;
I long that Thou wouldst saturate
Till Thou may overflow from me.--------814
"Man shall not live by bread alone,
But by each word which doth proceed
From God's own mouth"; these we must eat
And let them be our life indeed.

Not just a body we were made,
But body, soul, and spirit too;
The inmost part the spirit is
To contact God and Him pursue.

Just as we need the earthly food
Our body's need to satisfy,
We need the food for spirit too
Thyself, Thy Word, its true supply.

Thou art the Spirit, and Thy Word
Thy very Self expressed doth make;
Thus, it is Spirit as Thyself,
Which by our spirit we must take.

Thus, to receive Thy Word is not
To read it only with our eyes
And understand it in our mind,
But 'tis the spirit's exercise.

Thy Word in spirit we must eat
And to our inmost part receive;
'Tis by our spirit's exercise
To pray with what our minds perceive.

Thy Word remaining in our mind
Is only knowledge burdensome,
But when it to the spirit goes
Then life and spirit it becomes.

'Tis only when our spirit acts
To take Thy Word and contact Thee,
We truly feed upon Thy Word
And touch Thyself most inwardly.

Lord, teach us how to exercise
Our spirit when Thy Word we read;
Then will our spirit nourished be
As thus upon Thyself we feed.--------815
Christ is the Word and Spirit too,
And as the Spirit in the Word;
And all the words He speaks to us
Are life and spirit thus conferred.

The Holy Word we have without,
The Holy Spirit is within;
The greatest gifts divine are these,
That we may God enjoy therein.

The Word the Spirit doth express,
The Spirit its reality;
They're but two aspects of one thing
And should not separated be.

Whene'er the Spirit lights the Word
The Word becometh life to us;
When Word from Spirit is divorced,
'Tis empty mental stimulus.

When we the Word in spirit touch,
As life the Spirit it becomes;
The Spirit, when expressed from us,
As words of life to others comes.

Our spirit we must exercise
To take the Word most inwardly,
And then to give the Spirit forth;
The two as one with us should be.

Lord, may Thy Word in me become
The Spirit as my life supply,
And may Thy Spirit in Thy Word
My true expression be thereby.--------816
God's own Word must not be taken
Just as knowledge but as life,
Not alone God's thought conveying,
But Himself to us as life;
Not alone God's mind revealing,
But His Christ as life within,
Not alone the teaching giving,
But experience of Him.

It is only knowledge to us
If we in the letter read,
But when reading in the spirit
It is truly life indeed.
All the knowledge in the letter
Only brings us into death,
But the Word in spirit taken
Gives to us the quickening breath.

It we miss the Lord in Scripture,
It is just as knowledge vain;
But when Christ we touch within it,
Then His life we may obtain.
When we read, the Lord not touching,
'Tis but mental stimulus;
But when Christ we touch by reading,
It becometh life to us.

All the knowledge of the Scriptures
Into life must be transformed,
All the mental understanding
In the spirit must be formed;
All the Scriptural understanding
Must become the life received,
All the knowledge of the letters
In the spirit be conceived.

Just to touch the Word for knowledge
Is to take the very way
By which Eve was lured by Satan
And by knowledge led astray;
But as life to take the Scripture
Is the tree of life to eat;
Thus the Word we must be taking
In the spirit as our meat.--------817
We limit not the truth of God
To our poor reach of mind,
By notions of our day and sect,
Crude, partial and confined.
Now let a new and better hope
Within our hearts be stirred:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His Word.

Who dares to bind by his dull sense
The oracles of heaven,
For all the nations, tongues and climes
And all the ages given!
The universe how much unknown!
That ocean unexplored!
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His Word.

Darkling our great forefathers went
The first steps of the way;
'Twas but the dawning yet to grow
Into the perfect day;
And grow it shall, our glorious Sun
More fervid rays afford:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His Word.

The valleys past, ascending still,
Our souls would higher climb,
And look down from supernal heights,
On all the bygone times;
Upward we press, the air is clear,
And the sphere-music heard!
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His Word.

O Father, Son and Spirit, send
Us increase from above;
Enlarge, expand all Christian hearts
To comprehend Thy love;
And make us all go on to know
With nobler powers conferred:
The Lord hath yet more light and truth
To break forth from His Word.--------818
Christ is the mystery of God;
God is invisible, unshown,
His image man hath never seen,
But Christ the Son hath made Him known.

Christ is the very Word of God,
He is God's explanation true;
God's full embodiment is He
And God's own image brings to view.

Image of God invisible,
Effulgence of God's glory fair;
God's fulness ever dwells in Him,
God's testimony He doth bear.

The Church the myst'ry is of Christ,
For He is now to man unshown;
No man on earth may see Him now,
But thru the Church He is made known.

The Church is Christ's expression full,
In her Christ dwelleth bodily;
She is His duplication true,
And man in her Himself may see.

The Church the image has of Christ,
She is His increase and His spread;
Christ's very self is found in her,
The Body, she, to Christ the Head.

Thus, in the Son the Father is,
And now the Spirit is the Son;
The Spirit of the triune God
Is in the Church and with her one.--------819
As the body is the fulness
To express our life,
So to Christ the Church, His Body,
Doth express His life.

E'en as Eve is part of Adam
Taken out of him,
So the Church is Christ's own increase
With Himself within.

As from out the buried kernel
Many grains are formed,
As the grains together blended
To a loaf are formed;

So the Church, of many Christians,
Christ doth multiply,
Him expressing as one Body,
God to glorify.

As the branches of the grapevine
Are its outward spread,
With it one, abiding, bearing
Clusters in its stead;

So the Church's many members
Christ's enlargement are,
One with Him in life and living,
Spreading Him afar.

Fulness, increase, duplication,
His expression full,
Growth and spread, continuation,
Surplus plentiful,

Is the Church to Christ, and thereby
God in Christ may be
Glorified thru His redeemed ones
To eternity.

Thus the Church and Christ together,
God's great mystery,
Is the mingling of the Godhead
With humanity.--------820
Riches of Christ we should enjoy
And then His fulness we will be;
Partaking of His very self,
His testimony men will see.

Riches of Christ are what He is
To us who are His members true;
His fulness is what we become
As body doth to man accrue.

Riches of Christ are typified
By Canaan's produce rich and sweet,
With which the temple great was built,
The Church's greatest type replete.

As Eve to Adam fulness was,
So is the Church to Christ her Head;
As Eve from Adam's being came,
The Church by Christ's own life is bred.

Christ's riches are Himself within,
His fulness is the Church without,
As His expression, full of Him;
The Church with Christ is built throughout.--------821
The Church the vessel is to Christ,
Him to contain and Him express,
Just as the human body doth
Man's life show forth, his life possess.

As was the temple to the ark,
Receptacle and resting-place;
So Christ the Church's content is,
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.

As Christ is God's true mystery,
God to explain and God express;
So is the Church Christ's mystery,
Christ to explain and manifest.

The members of the Church of Christ
Are all primarily of clay;
They need to be transformed and made
Transparent, precious day by day.

By transformation they are built,
A vessel they to Christ afford;
His all-inclusiveness they hold;
Transparent, they express the Lord.

Thru all the transformation work
The triune God performs in them,
The Church a corporate vessel is
And like the new Jerusalem.

How precious she in each respect,
Transparent too in every phase;
Christ with God's fulness she contains,
Christ with God's glory she displays.

With Christ as life, with God as light,
And with the Spirit's living flow,
The triune God she manifests
For all the universe to know.--------822
The Church the lampstand is to Christ,
Christ is the lamp with God as light;
The light divine from Christ doth shine,
The Church upholds its glory bright.

The light which shines within the lamp
Is God as life, unique, divine;
The stand must therefore be of gold
To match the glory which doth shine.

Amid the darkness of this age
The light of life divine doth beam
In many centers of mankind
Where Jesus' testimony's seen.

To be this testimony pure
"First love" to Christ the Church must keep;
Then from the "tree of life" she may
The overcomer's portion reap.

She must the persecution bear
That she the "crown of life" may gain;
Adult'ry spiritual o'ercome,
The "hidden manna" to obtain.

The deeds of "Jezebel" desert,
That she may rule the earth with might;
Defiling deadness overcome
To be arrayed in "garments white."

Like "Philadelphia" she must be
To keep Christ's word, confess His Name;
All "lukewarm" pride she must o'ercome
To feast with Him who overcame.

Thus will the Church be purified
To be the lampstand of pure gold,
To match the testimony pure,
The life of Jesus fit to hold.

The local churches here on earth
The lampstands in this age should be;
The glorious new Jerusalem
The lampstand in eternity.

10 The city as pure gold will be,
The final lampstand consummate;
Christ as the lamp she e'er will hold
And God's full light will radiate.--------823
God before the world's foundation
Chose the Church in Christ the Son,
That the Church might share the sonship,
Holy, blameless, with Him one;
That the Church be His possession
With the Spirit as the seal,
Of our heritage the earnest
While His Son He does reveal.

To the throne Christ has ascended,
Far above all rule and power;
God has made Him Head o'er all things
To the Church, His Body here.
All in He ever filleth,
And His fulness is expressed
Through the Church, which is His Body
And His image manifests.

We, once dead in our offences,
Walking in the worldly course,
Lusts of flesh and mind fulfilling,
Satan and his hosts their source,
God with Christ has resurrected,
Seated in the heavenlies;
We, His masterpiece, created
In Christ Jesus, Him to please.

Jews and Gentiles are one body
God His myst'ry has made known
On apostles, prophets founded,
Jesus Christ the cornerstone;
We in Him are built together
For God's dwelling manifest,
Fitly framed by God the Spirit
For His pleasure and His rest.

In eternal ages purposed
That His wisdom be made known,
Was the Church, His hidden myst'ry,
Where the Son could make His home;
That the saints may all in spirit
Apprehend His boundlessness,
Know His love which passes knowledge,
All God's fulness to possess.

One in body, hope, and Spirit,
One in faith, one Lord, the Son,
One baptizing, with one Father,
That the Church may thus be one;
Christ to know in all His fulness,
Unto manhood be matured,
Ne'er by winds of doctrine carried,
Nor by cunning men allured.

Many gifts the Lord has given,
That His Body He may build,
That the saints may be perfected
And their ministry fulfilled.
Thus we must put off the old man
That we may put on the new;
Thus, renewed in mind and spirit,
We will bear God's image true.

Christ in love Himself has given
That the Church be sanctified,
Without blemish, spot, or wrinkle,
To become His glorious bride.
He does nourish her and cherish
As a man his body treats;
He and she become one body
Thus the myst'ry very great.

Body, house, new man the Church is,
Bride, and temple, and yet more:
She's the army too which fighteth
All God's foe to triumph o'er.
She is clothed with all God's armor,
In His mighty strength is strong,
Standing in the Lord, resisting,
With all prayers she fighteth on.--------824
The Church is Christ's own Body,
The Father's dwelling-place,
The gathering of the called ones,
God blended with man's race;
Elect before creation,
Redeemed by Calv'ry's death,
Her character and standing
Of heaven, not of earth.

New man of new creation,
Born through her risen Lord,
Baptized in God the Spirit,
Made holy by His Word;
Christ is her life and content,
Himself her glorious Head;
She has ascended with Him
O'er all her foes to tread.

Christ is her one foundation,
None other man may lay;
All that she has, as Christ, is
Divine in every way;
Her members through the Spirit
Their death on Calv'ry own;
They're built in resurrection
Gold, silver, precious stone.

One God, one Lord, one Spirit
Her elements all one
One faith, one hope, one baptism,
One Body in the Son;
The triune God is in her,
One Body members own,
By faith they are united,
In hope of glory shown.

From every tribe and nation
Do all the members come,
Regardless of their classes
United to be one.
No high there is, nor lowly,
No Jew, nor Gentile clan,
No free, nor slave, nor master,
But Christ, the "one new man."

One Body universal,
One in each place expressed;
Locality of dwelling
Her only ground possessed;
Administration local,
Each answ'ring to the Lord;
Communion universal,
Upheld in one accord.

Her local gatherings model
The New Jerusalem;
Its aspects and its details
Must show in all of them.
Christ is the Lamp that shineth,
With God within, the Light;
They are the lampstands bearing
His glorious Image bright.--------825
Church of God, beloved and chosen,
Church of Christ for whom He died,
Claim thy gifts and praise the Giver,
Ye are washed and sanctified.
Sanctified by God the Father,
And by Jesus Christ His Son,
And by God the Holy Spirit,
Holy, Holy, Three in One.

By His will He sanctifieth,
By the Spirit's power within;
By the loving hand that chasteneth
Fruits of righteousness to win;
By His truth and by His promise,
By the Word, His gift unpriced,
By His own blood, and by union
With the risen life of Christ.

Holiness by faith in Jesus,
Not by effort of thine own,
Sin's dominion crushed and broken
By the power of grace alone,
Christ, the holiness within thee,
His own beauty on thy brow:
This shall be thy pilgrim brightness,
This thy blessed portion now.

He will sanctify thee wholly;
Body, spirit, soul shall be
Blameless till thy Savior's coming
In His glorious majesty!
He hath perfected forever
Those whom He hath sanctified:
Spotless, glorious, and holy,
Is the Church, His chosen Bride.--------826
I saw great throngs  each was a brother dear,
Linked with each other in one Body here;
Each in close union with the living Head,
The witness-folk, by Jesus' Spirit led.

At every time, in every clime I found
Those, not with words of Christ, but Spirit bound.
He strengthens them with might each day, each hour;
Through them true works divine are wrought in power.

This is the Church the Spirit hath begot,
Elect from every people, Christ their lot.
They follow where His shepherd-staff doth lead;
The members of this host are blessed indeed.

And when on earth they meet His death to show,
To Him their vows of love they oft renew.
Some little flock will gather there or here;
Christ, Head of all, to every soul most near.

This is the temple which our Lord approves,
The Church which truly honors Him and loves,
Whose sacrifice is on the altar bound;
She soon in glory will His throne surround.--------827
I have found life's Giver, and the Prince of Life;
He has quenched my thirst, and vanquished all my strife.
He, my living bread, became my daily meat;
Death has died in me, Life's triumph is complete.

In the Church, what glory! Far horizons glow!
And His Name all radiant on each brow doth show.
Christ doth breathe upon her, He's her living Rock,
Shepherd of His sheep all gathered in one flock.

There one holy flame doth burn within each breast;
By one blood redeemed, in Christ they find their rest.
All their thirst He quenches from one living stream;
They in adoration lowly worship Him.

There as Bread of life faint souls He ever feeds;
There each hungry soul may take whate'er he needs.
Lovingly He draws each soul that truly lives,
And in bread and wine Himself to them He gives.

Gone is all the earth-taint thru abounding grace;
Hear the song of triumph from the ransomed race.
All in glory shining, glory not their own,
Blended into oneness, they approach the throne.--------828
The "churches" here below, so narrow bound,
Reach not the hungry throngs which us surround;
They run partway with truth, but miss the goal.
Earth-vision blurred and dim, their eyes doth hold
But broken gleams have they of radiance gold;
Too dazzling is the splendor of the whole.

Brothers with brothers have not all one heart,
In wrath they turn away and walk apart,
Who from one stream of life had common birth.
What fight for forms! O'er doctrines what vain strife!
Instead together sharing God's one life,
Who worshipped is by heaven and by earth.

"Where is the truth?" I asked; for this I longed:
None answered right 'mid all the answering throng;
For ever side by side lay light and shade.
"Where is," I cried, "the one communion pure?
Where is the Church in which, clear-traced and sure,
The Spirit's very likeness is portrayed?"

So sought I long, and hopeless was my quest;
These eyes grew dim and blind and found no rest,
Till God's touch opened them, and I was freed.
I found the Spirit's Church in souls made one
In this, that they in troth to Christ had come
His Bride, to follow where the cross may lead.

Thus when I see this small world's narrow thought,
Behold the brother not with brother brought,
Yet serving Christ  as each one deemeth right
Ah, then a voice from realms of glory calls,
Where the last veil is rent and earthward falls,
And where God's love, eternal, burneth bright.

No more we put that query without end,
To which self-chosen church our feet did trend
What doctrine we believed, what sacred rites.
In Christ we were in bonds that nought could break;
Who, by His cross and death, do all forsake,
Such as were far asunder He unites.

No longer does one heed mere formal phrase,
Or seek for others' creeds through winding maze,
For in Himself was truth made manifest.
And out of every tongue and every land
He formed one Church to meet His own demand
His Body, where His fulness is expressed.--------829
The Church's seed is nought but Christ Himself
Sown into human hearts as life, thereby
Growing as wheat, producing flour fine
For bread both God and man to satisfy.

But Satan hath the false believers sown
Among the saints as tares among the wheat,
To bring confusion and to hinder growth
That they may not fulfill God's plan complete.

The Church's life just as the herb must be,
Grown out of Christ, who is the mustard seed;
Hidden and transient, little on the earth,
But good for food the hungry ones to feed.

But Satan came and made the little herb
To change its nature and to change its form,
That fully grown it did a tree become
Where many evil ones may lodge and swarm.

Satan has also used the fallen "church"
Evil and heathen practice to include,
As leaven mingled with the meal of wheat,
Thus to corrupt its purity as food.

But Christ as life would so transform the saints
That they may be as pearl and precious stone,
As the materials suitable to build
Into His Church to make His Kingdom known.

Such an assembly grown in Christ as life,
Transformed and built with Christ in them annealed,
Is as the goodly pearl for preciousness
And as the treasure hidden in the field.

Lord, separate us from the devil's "tares,"
Each on deliver from the monstrous "tree,"
From all the "leaven" may Thou purify,
That we may be as food to man and Thee.

Cause us to grow in life divine each day
That we may be transformed and built by Thee
Into a body to express Thyself,
That Thou in us Thy Church and Kingdom see.--------830
Faith of our fathers, living still
In spite of dungeon, fire and sword,
O how our hearts beat high with joy
Whene'er we hear that glorious word!
Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Our fathers, chained in prisons dark,
Were still in heart and conscience free;
And blest would be their children's fate,
If they, like them should die for thee:
Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Faith of our fathers, we will strive
To win all nations unto thee;
And through the truth that comes from God
Mankind shall then indeed be free.
Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!

Faith of our fathers, we will love
Both friend and foe in all our strife,
And preach thee, too, as love knows how
By kindly words and virtuous life.
Faith of our fathers! Holy faith!
We will be true to thee till death!--------831
The unity of the Church is but
The saints in oneness living;
The Spirit which indwelleth them
This oneness ever giving.
Thus it is realized and called
The unity of Spirit;
'Tis based upon the common faith
Which all the saints inherit.

This precious faith of all the saints,
Is constituted solely
Of Christ and His redemptive work,
Which are unique and holy.
In this the saints are truly one,
Together all agreeing,
And it is from this common faith
The Church came into being.

The Church within the universe
Is one as Christ's possession;
The Church must therefore locally
Be one in her expression;
For all her elements are one
One God, one Lord, one Spirit,
One faith, baptism, Body too,
One hope all saints inherit.

This oneness is the Church's ground,
The ground of common standing,
The only ground of unity
The Spirit is demanding.
The Church in actual practise thus
May keep her vital union,
And her expressions locally
Be built up in communion.

Lord, help us ever strive to keep
This unity by taking
The Church's ground of unity,
The Body-life partaking,
That all Thy heart's profound desire
May fully be effected,
And God's eternal purpose may
Completely be perfected.--------832
Christ the Son of God and His redemptive deed
Are the saving faith which is our only creed.
All the other doctrines do not faith comprise;
Christ, His work and person, only qualifies.

All the other teachings used improperly
Are the "winds of doctrine," spoiling unity:
Blowing saints away from Christ who is the Head,
Building not the Body, tearing down instead.

Thus we must relinquish doctrines of all kinds,
Only keep the faith that oneness we may find.
In the Lord the Spirit we are one indeed;
Just to keep this oneness is our only need.

Truth we must be holding, which is Christ Himself,
That we be delivered from the sects of self,
That in all things growing into Christ the Head,
Built will be the Body and to fulness led.

To the "unity of faith" we must attain,
All the "winds of doctrine" evermore disdain;
Holding Christ the Spirit, our reality,
For the Body's growing in its unity.--------833
The Church's one foundation
Is Jesus Christ her Lord;
She is His new creation
By water and the Word:
From heav'n He came and sought her
To be His holy Bride;
With His own blood He bought her,
And for her life He died.

Elect from every nation,
Yet one o'er all the earth,
Her charter of salvation,
One Lord, one faith, one birth;
One holy Name she blesses,
Partakes one holy food,
And to one hope she presses,
With every grace endued.

'Mid toil and tribulation,
And tumult of her war,
She waits the consummation
Of peace for evermore;
Till, with the vision glorious,
Her longing eyes are blest,
And the great Church victorious
Shall be the Church at rest.

Yet she on earth hath union
With God the Three in One,
And mystic sweet communion
With those whose rest is won:
O happy ones and holy!
Lord, give us grace that we,
Like them, the meek and lowly,
In love may dwell with Thee.--------834
The chief Cornerstone Thou art, Lord,
Jewish builders did despise;
God by resurrection placed Thee,
Thou art precious in His eyes.
Through Thee we receive salvation,
And, together built by Thee,
Jews and Gentiles are Thy dwelling,
One new man, in harmony.

Thou too art the smitten Rock, Lord,
That man's thirst by Thee be filled,
That frail man may stand upon Thee,
But e'en more, God's house to build.
The Foundation Stone in Zion,
Tested and secure, Thou art;
And the Rock, the Church supporting,
Her foundation to impart.

On Thyself the Church is builded,
And though many storms assail,
Still it stands erect, for 'gainst it
Gates of hell cannot prevail.
Thine authority possessing,
It doth bind and loose in Thee,
Bringing men into Thy kingdom,
Satan's captives setting free.

Living Stone of life art Thou, Lord,
Precious, chosen thus to be;
Living stones Thou too hast made us,
One in character with Thee.
Built together as a temple
That our God may dwell therein,
Thus we are a holy priesthood,
Offering sacrifice to Him.

Lord, Thou art the Son of David
That God's temple Thou may build;
King and Priest Thou art together,
That Thy calling be fulfilled.
As the King, for God Thou rulest,
Making men submit to Him;
As the Priest before God's presence,
Bringing men to enter in.

Thine authority doth issue
From the throne to render peace;
Fellowship is in the river
To supply and give increase.
When these, balanced, go together,
Then God's purpose is fulfilled;
King and Priest in Thee combining,
Thou God's dwelling place dost build.

Thou art God, yet flesh becamest,
God with man in Thee doth dwell;
Thou, the Temple for His glory,
God in Thee Himself doth tell.
Thus the Church too is the mingling
Into one of God and man;
So it is with every member
For the building of God's plan.

Thou, the everlasting Dwelling,
In all ages art our home;
We in Thee enjoy protection,
Living in Thyself alone.
Thou our Sanctuary art, Lord,
We and God abide in Thee;
Thou, God's presence art within us,
Where we worship ceaselessly.

Cornerstone, Foundation, Topstone,
Rock, and Church, and Living Stone,
Dwelling-place, and Sanctuary,
Builder too art Thou, we own.
Praise we give for what Thou art, Lord,
As Thy wondrousness we see!
Grant that we may be built up, Lord,
As the living stones in Thee.--------835
On Christ, salvation rests secure;
The Rock of Ages must endure;
Nor can that faith be overthrown
Which rest upon the "Living Stone."

No other hope shall intervene;
To Him we look, on Him we lean;
Other foundations we disown,
And build on Christ, the "Living Stone."

In Him it is ordained to raise
A temple to Jehovah's praise,
Composed of all His saints, who own
No Savior but the "Living Stone."

View the vast building, see it rise:
The work how great! The plan how wise!
O wondrous fabric! Pow'r unknown:
That rests it on the "Living Stone."

But most adore His precious name:
His glory and His grace proclaim!
For us, the lost, condemned, undone,
He gave Himself, the "Living Stone."--------836
Christ is made the sure foundation,
Christ the head and cornerstone,
Chosen of the Lord and precious,
Binding all the Church in one;
Holy Zion's help forever,
And her confidence alone.

Founded on the Lord victorious,
Christ the everlasting Rock,
Stands the Church in heav'nly places,
Dreading not the storm or shock;
Built with life divine she ever
Stands against attack and mock.

Though the gates of Hades frustrate,
Yet the Church still stands for God,
Overcoming evil spirits
By her Lord's victorious blood;
And at Christ's return in triumph
All her foes will then be trod.--------837
We praise Thee, Lord, for Thy great plan
That we Thy dwelling-place may be;
Thou live in us, we filled with Thee,
Thou in the Son expressed might be.

Though in Thine image made by Thee
And given Thine authority,
Yet we are only made of clay
Without a trace of divinity.

When we receive Thee as our life,
Thy nature we thru grace possess;
Mingled together, we with Thee
One Body glorious will express.

When flows Thy life thru all our souls,
Filling, renewing every part,
We will be pearls and precious stones,
Changed to Thine image, as Thou art.

But, Lord, we fully realize
These are not wrought men's praise to rouse,
But as material to be built
Together for Thy glorious house.

Here, Lord, we give ourselves to Thee;
Receive us into Thy wise hands;
Bend, break, and build together in Thee
To be the house to meet Thy demands.

Break all the natural life for us,
Deal Thou with each peculiar way,
That we no more independent be
But with all saints are one for aye.

Then we shall be Thy Bride beloved,
Together in Thy chamber abide,
Enjoy the fulness of Thy love.
How Thou wilt then be satisfied!--------838
Thy blueprint, Lord, I treasure dear,
It shows Thy tabernacle real,
It tells how Thou wouldst have it built,
How Thou Thy glory wouldst reveal.

The ark's the center of the tent,
The tent is but its resting-place:
In it the ten commandments are,
And in the tent it ever stays.

The ark the God-man, Christ, displays
God mixed with man, as gold, wood meet;
The law is God's expression full,
Which dwells in Christ the Son complete.

Thus Christ's the center of the Church,
Which is to Him a resting-place;
In Christ the Father ever dwells,
And in the Church, Christ's dwelling-place.

The tent's the increase of the ark,
Both are of wood with gold o'erlaid;
The Church the increase is of Christ,
God blent with man here too displayed.

The boards when joined support the tent
On silver sockets standing sure;
Gold overlaid, with golden rings
And interlocking bars, secure.

The Church is thus the gathered saints,
On Christ's redemption standing sure;
In life divine, by Spirit bound,
Together built and framed secure.

The tent's four-layered cover shows
The Christ of God in every phase;
God's glory thus is signified,
Covering His holy dwelling-place.

Covered by such a glorious Christ,
All saints together knit may be;
Enjoying all He is for them,
In Him they're builded gloriously.

10 The law is placed within the ark,
The ark within the tent doth rest;
So God in Christ within the Church
His wondrous glory manifests.--------839
Lord, Thou art a potter skilled
And a glorious builder too,
Molding for Thy vessel great,
Building with Thy house in view.
I am both a man of clay
And a new-made living stone,
That Thy vessel I may be
And the temple Thou wouldst own.

Though of clay Thou madest us.
Thou wouldst have us be transformed;
With Thy life as purest gold,
Unto precious stones conformed.
We shall, through Thy building work,
Then become Thy loving Bride,
In one Body joined to Thee,
That Thy heart be satisfied.

What Thy heart desires and loves
Are not precious stones alone,
But together these to build
For Thy glory, for Thy home.
Thou, the all-inclusive Christ,
Dost a builded Church require,
That Thy glorious riches may
Radiate their light entire.

Not the person spiritual
In an individual way,
But the corporate life expressed
Will Thy heart's desire display.
Members separate and detached
Ne'er express Thee perfectly,
But Thy Body tempered, built,
Ever shall Thy fulness be.

Build me, Lord, with other saints,
Independence ne'er allow,
But according to Thy plan
Fitly frame and join me now.
In experience not my boast,
Nor in gifts would be my pride;
For Thy building I give all,
That Thou may be glorified.--------840
Freed from self and Adam's nature,
Lord, I would be built by Thee
With the saints into Thy temple,
Where Thy glory we shall see.
From peculiar traits deliver,
From my independent ways,
That a dwelling place for Thee, Lord,
We will be thru all our days.

By Thy life and by its flowing
I can grow and be transformed,
With the saints coordinated,
Builded up, to Thee conformed;
Keep the order in the Body,
There to function in Thy will,
Ever serving, helping others,
All Thy purpose to fulfill.

In my knowledge and experience
I would not exalted be,
But submitting and accepting
Let the Body balance me;
Holding fast the Head, and growing
With His increase, in His way,
By the joints and bands supplying,
Knit together day by day.

By Thy Spirit daily strengthened
In the inner man with might,
I would know Thy love surpassing,
Know Thy breadth and length and height;
Ever of Thy riches taking,
Unto all Thy fulness filled,
Ever growing into manhood,
That Thy Body Thou may build.

In God's house and in Thy Body
Builded up I long to be,
That within this corporate vessel
All shall then Thy glory see;
That Thy Bride, the glorious city,
May appear upon the earth,
As a lampstand brightly beaming
To express to all Thy worth.--------841
Thou art all my life, Lord,
In me Thou dost live;
With Thee all God's fulness
Thou to me dost give.
By Thy holy nature
I am sanctified,
By Thy resurrection,
Vict'ry is supplied.

Now Thy flowing life, Lord,
Doth enlighten me,
Bringing in the spirit
Fellowship with Thee;
All my need supplying,
Making Thy demand,
Leading me to cleansing
And in Thee to stand.

Thy anointing Spirit
Me shall permeate,
All my soul and spirit
Thou wouldst saturate;
Every part transforming
Till conformed to Thee,
Till Thy life shall bring me
To maturity.

Lord, Thy life abundant,
Flowing, rich and free,
Constantly refreshes
And empowers me.
Death by life is swallowed,
Weakness is made strong,
All my bonds are broken,
Gloom is turned to song.

I would give myself, Lord,
Fully unto Thee,
That Thy heart's desire
Be fulfilled in me.
I no more would struggle
To myself reform,
Thus in me to hinder
What Thou wouldst perform.

I would cease completely
From my efforts vain,
Let Thy life transform me,
Full release to gain;
Build me up with others
Till in us Thou see
Thy complete expression
Glorifying Thee.--------842
Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me,
My drooping spirit raise;
Deliver me from fear and death
Into Thy life of praise.

Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me,
Strength to my spirit bring,
That running, walking, fainting not,
I'll mount on eagles' wings.

Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me,
That I may enter rest,
That heart and spirit joyful be
By leaning on Thy breast.

Breathe Thou, O Lord, on me
Till filled with Thee, I plead,
No longer I that live, but Christ
In thought, and word, and deed.

Breathe Thou on me and touch
My independency,
That in Thy Body I'll be built
With all the saints in Thee.--------843
Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me,
I'm as a bone disjoined and dry;
O may Thou quicken and restore me
And with Thy Body unify.

Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me,
My spirit is so bound and slow;
O break my shackles and release me,
To mingle in Thy Body's flow.

Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me,
My burdened spirit cannot rise;
May Thou encourage and revive me
To share Thy Body's full supplies.

Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me,
My barren spirit has no joy;
O may Thou satisfy and bless me,
Thy Body's riches to enjoy.

Lord, breathe Thy breath of life upon me,
To me a true dependence give;
Deal with my death and isolation,
That in Thy Body I may live.--------844
Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe;
Behold, dry bones fill all the earth
In graves and scattered 'round in death;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!

Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe,
Revive the bones with quickening breath,
That we may leave our graves, our death;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!

Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe,
Thy people all to make alive,
A mighty host, the foe to drive;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!

Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe,
That all Thy people may be one,
Led by the headship of the Son;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!

Lord, speak Thy Word, upon us breathe,
Thy people fitly frame with grace
To be Thy rest, Thy dwelling-place;
Lord, speak and breathe upon us!

Lord, speak to me, upon me breathe,
Revive me, in Thy Body build,
No more secluded and self-willed;
Breathe now, O Lord, upon me!

Lord, speak to me, upon me breathe,
That with Thy saints the foe I'll fight,
That in Thy house Thou may delight,
Breathe now, O Lord, upon me!--------845
Release my spirit! This is what I need:
O may my spirit with the saints' be knit;
No more in private ways Thyself to seek,
But freed from self and for Thy building fit.

Release my spirit! This is what I ask,
That self-confined or closed I may not be;
How deep within myself I long have been,
If Thou deliver not, I'll ne'er be free.

Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I pray,
That from myself I fully may come forth;
Thy Spirit then through me may freely flow,
And Thou Thy presence fully may show forth.

Release my spirit! This is what I want,
That I from my seclusion may depart;
My private seeking poverty has brought,
Now save from self, Thy wealth to me impart.

Release my spirit! This is what I seek,
That prisoned in my self no more I'll be;
By Satan's cunning cheated nevermore,
But loosed from self to Thine infinity.

Release my spirit! 'Tis for this I yearn,
That self may bind my spirit nevermore;
With all the saints I'd mingle in Thy life,
And all Thou art enjoy forevermore.--------846
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
Now I beseech Thee, Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
My past I would forsake,
The iron walls would break,
My spirit free would make;
Oh, may it flow!

Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
Now I implore Thee, Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
No more self-satisfied,
No more in self-bound pride,
No more my spirit tied;
Oh, may it flow!

Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
For this I plead with Thee,
Oh, may it flow!
High-minded not to be,
Pride shall not prison me,
I'd flow unceasingly,
In spirit flow.

Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
For this I seek Thee, Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
No more to isolate,
Nor self to perfect make,
My spirit nought abate,
Deeply to flow.

Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
I ask Thee, gracious Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
My trust in self o'erthrow,
Down from self's throne I'll go,
That living water flow
In spirit, Lord.

Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
Answer my prayer, dear Lord,
Oh, may it flow!
Not just commune with Thee,
I long to builded be,
Mingle with others free
In spirit, Lord.--------847
I long for fellowship in spirit,
That mingled with the saints I'll be,
Long to be saved from independence
And to be built with saints in Thee.

I long for fellowship in spirit,
That opened shall my spirit be,
Long to be rescued from seclusion,
And with the saints to worship Thee.

I long for fellowship in spirit,
Long that my spirit forth may come,
Long to be saved from self-deception,
And every hindrance overcome.

I long for fellowship in spirit,
With saints in spirit thus to pray,
Long for deliv'rance from pretension,
Long for true fellowship today.

I long for fellowship in spirit,
Long thus to know authority;
Long for true fellowship in service,
Coordinated thus to be.

O Lord, fulfill our heart's deep longing,
Saints for such fellowship inspire,
That we may realize Thy building
And soon fulfill Thy heart's desire.--------848
What a blessing, what a priv'lege!
Called of God a royal priest,
That this glorious, holy office
I should bear, though last and least.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

If I keep this royal calling
Under Thine authority,
Priestly duty thus fulfilling,
Then the church will builded be.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

Now the church is but the priesthood;
Thus the priesthood formed we need;
When the priests are knit together,
Then the church is built indeed.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

Through the church's degradation,
Saints this office desolate;
Through the weakness of their spirits
Preaching doth predominate.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

Most are leaning on the message
And the preaching emphasize,
Yet neglect the priestly praying
And their spirits' exercise.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

Deal with me and make me balanced,
As in preaching, so in prayer;
Leading others oft in praying,
As Thy Word I too declare.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.

Only serving by our praying
Will our spirits mingled be;
Stressing prayer as much as preaching
Thus the church is built for Thee.

  All the building of the Body
  On the priesthood doth depend;
  Ever praying in the spirit
  I this office would attend.--------849
Holy priests are living stones
For God's building work today;
If these stones would builded be
All the priests must learn to pray.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

All the saints must serve as priests,
That the living stones they be;
Each must priestly work perform,
Then their functions we will see.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

Tent and priests of olden times
Always did together go;
When the priests served in the tent,
Into one the two did flow.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

Now the building spiritual
And the priesthood all are one;
Now the building of the house
By the priestly work is done.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

In the priests the substance is
Of the building work replete;
When the priests their work discharge,
Then God's house will be complete.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

Building God and man in one
Is their work before the Lord;
In this fellowship divine
Saints are built in one accord.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

When in prayer our spirits blend,
Then together built are we,
Then a priesthood we become,
Off'ring sacrifice to Thee.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.

Grant us grace, O Lord, that we
Treasure dear the priestly call;
In the spirit serve and pray,
That Thy church be built withal.

  To the holiest often come,
  In the spirit touch the throne,
  Let the Lord flow thru in prayer,
  Thus the building work is done.--------850
O Lord, we have loved her fair beauty,
The house Thou hast chosen for Thee,
The courts where Thy gladness rejoiceth,
And where Thou delightest to be.
We love to be made the fair dwelling
Where God in His grace may abide;
We'd cast forth whatever may grieve Thee,
And welcome none other beside.

O blessed the grace that has made us
The home of the gladness of God,
The dwelling wherein Thou delightest,
The house Thou hast bought with Thy blood.
'Tis there that Thy joy overfloweth,
We feel it, we take of it there;
By all that Thou workest within us,
Thy temple is holy and fair.

The secret of that inner chamber,
Thy place is of heavenly rest;
The stillness of thoughts that adore Thee,
The shrine that Thou lovest the best.
The temple where Christ hath His dwelling,
The souls He hath ransomed, forgiv'n;
The temple where I have my dwelling,
Is Christ in the glory of heav'n.--------851
How lovely is Thy dwelling-place!
Within Thy courts I long to be;
Thy presence, Lord, my spirit craves,
For this my heart cries out to Thee.

At Thy burnt-offering altar, Lord,
And at Thine incense altar blest,
Even the sparrow finds a home,
And swallow there prepares her nest.

Men, as the sparrow, frail and small,
When living in Thy house find rest,
Relying on the altar's blood,
Enjoying there the incense blest.

How blessed are those men indeed!
Trusting in Thee they are made strong;
Highways to Zion in their hearts,
The way they care not, rough or long.

Passing the weeping valley they
Make it a place of springing wells;
The rain with blessings covers it
And in the way God's mercy tells.

From strength to strength they go, and all
Before the Lord in Zion meet;
Thus ever seeking Thine own self,
They need Thy care and grace replete.

Better a day within Thy courts
Than days a thousand I would tell;
I'd rather at Thy threshold stand
Than in the wicked's tents to dwell.

Thou art a sun, Thou art a shield,
Thou grace and glory wilt supply;
Thy presence and Thy very self
My need in fulness satisfy.

Not one good thing wilt Thou withhold
From those who walk in uprightness;
Bless'd is the man that trusts in Thee
With grace and glory measureless.--------852
Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church so blessed,
It is Thy joy and heart's delight
And where Thy heart finds rest.

For her, Thyself Thou gavest, Lord,
That she be Thine, complete;
For her, I too my body give,
Thy heart's desire to meet.

For her, Thou hast become my life,
That she my living be;
For her, I would forsake myself,
That she be filled with Thee.

The Church is Thy beloved Bride,
Thou in Thy Body seen;
She is my joy and heart's desire,
The one on whom I lean.

In her, Thy full supply, O Lord,
Thou dost to me impart;
In her am I possessed by Thee
To satisfy Thy heart.

Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church, Thy home;
In it I would forever live
And never longer roam.--------853
I love Thy kingdom, Lord,
The house of Thine abode,
The Church our blest Redeemer bought
With His own precious blood.

I love the Church, O God!
Her walls before Thee stand,
Dear as the apple of Thine eye
And graven on Thy hand.

For her my tears shall fall,
For her my prayers ascend;
To her my cares and toils be given
Till toils and cares shall end.

Beyond my highest joy
I prize her heavenly ways,
Her sweet communion, solemn vows,
Her hymns of love and praise.

Sure as Thy truth shall last,
To Zion shall be given
The brightest glories earth can yield,
And brighter bliss of heaven.--------854
All the saints of Christ are
Members every one;
All coordinating
Into oneness come.

Though the gifts are many,
Yet the Spirit one;
Many too the functions,
But one Lord, the Son.

Each, the others needing,
Must impartial be;
Each his place possesses
And utility.

By our grace are measured
Gifts both large and small;
Each with sober judgment
Takes his place with all.

Each fulfills his duty,
Shows his usefulness,
Fervent in the spirit,
Girt with faithfulness.

Knitting and supplying,
Bearing much in grace;
Not a trace of discord,
Christ is giv'n His place.

We, the Church, His Body,
He, the Head, the Son;
By the Spirit's flowing,
We are joined in one.--------855
Behold, how good, how pleasant 'tis
When brethren dwell in one!
'Tis like the oil on Aaron's head,
Which to his skirts did run;
As dew of Hermon that descends
On Zion's mountains o'er;
The Lord His blessing there commands,
E'en life forevermore.--------856
How pleasant and how good it is
When brethren in the Lord
In one another's joy delight
And dwell in sweet accord.

Such oneness, like anointing oil
On head to body poured;
Such oneness, like the morning dew,
With sweet refreshment stored.

To those who dwell in brotherhood
The Lord His blessing sends,
He crowns them with the bliss of life,
Of life that never ends.--------857
How sweet, how heav'nly is the sight,
When those who love the Lord
In one another's peace delight,
And so fulfill His Word;

When each can feel his brother's sigh,
And with him bear a part;
When sorrow flows from eye to eye,
And joy from heart to heart;

When, free from envy, scorn and pride,
Our wishes all above,
Each can his brother's failings hide,
And show a brother's love;

When love, in one delightful stream,
Through every bosom flows;
When union sweet, and dear esteem,
In every action glows.

Love is the golden chain that binds;
The saints Thy grace thus prove.
And he is glory's heir that finds
His bosom glow with love.--------858
All praise to our redeeming Lord,
Who joins us by His grace,
And bids us, each to each restored,
Together seek His face,
Together seek His face.

He bids us build each other up;
And, gathered into one,
To our high calling's glorious hope,
We hand in hand go on,
We hand in hand go on.

The gift which He on one bestows,
We all delight to prove;
The grace through every vessel flows,
In purest streams of love,
In purest streams of love.

We all partake the joy of one;
The common peace we feel;
A peace to worldly minds unknown,
A joy unspeakable,
A joy unspeakable.

And if our fellowship below
In Christ yet be so sweet,
What height of rapture shall we know,
When round His throne we meet,
When round His throne we meet!--------859
Let party names no more
The Christian world o'erspread;
Gentile and Jew, and bond and free,
Are one in Christ, their Head.

Among the saints on earth
Let mutual love be found;
Heirs of the same inheritance,
With mutual blessings crowned.

Let envy, child of hell!
Be banished far away:
Those in sweet fellowship should dwell,
Who the same Lord obey.

Thus will the Church below
God's purpose ever prove;
Where streams of endless pleasure flow,
And every heart is love.--------860
Blest be the tie that binds
Our hearts in Christian love;
The fellowship our spirit finds
Is like to that above.

Before our Father's throne,
We pour our ardent prayers;
Our fears, our hopes, our aims are one
Our comforts and our cares.

We share our mutual woes;
Our mutual burdens bear;
And often of each other flows
The sympathizing tear.

When we asunder part,
It gives us inward pain;
But we shall still be joined in heart,
And hope to meet again.

From sorrow, toil, and pain,
And sin we shall be free;
And perfect love and oneness reign
Through all eternity.--------861
God be with you till we meet again;
By His counsels guide, uphold you,
With His sheep in love enfold you;
God be with you till we meet again.

  Till we meet, till we meet,
  Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
  Till we meet, till we meet,
  God be with you till we meet again.

God be with you till we meet again!
'Neath His wings protecting hide you,
Daily manna still provide you;
God be with you till we meet again!

  Till we meet, till we meet,
  Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
  Till we meet, till we meet,
  God be with you till we meet again.

God be with you till we meet again!
When life's perils thick confound you,
Put His arms unfailing round you;
God be with you till we meet again!

  Till we meet, till we meet,
  Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
  Till we meet, till we meet,
  God be with you till we meet again.

God be with you till we meet again!
Keep love's banner floating o'er you,
Smite death's threatening wave before you;
God be with you till we meet again!

  Till we meet, till we meet,
  Till we meet at Jesus' feet;
  Till we meet, till we meet,
  God be with you till we meet again.--------862
Jesus, where'er Thy people meet,
There they behold Thy mercy-seat;
Where'er they seek Thee, Thou art found,
With grace and mercy to abound.

For Thou, within no walls confined,
Inhabitest the humble mind;
Such ever bring Thee where they come,
And going, take Thee to their home.

Dear Shepherd of Thy chosen few,
Thy former mercies here renew;
Here, to our waiting hearts, proclaim
The sweetness of Thy saving Name.

Here may we prove the power of prayer
To strengthen faith and sweeten care;
To teach our faint desires to rise,
And bring Thy light before our eyes.

Lord, we are few, but Thou art near;
Nor short Thine arm, nor deaf Thine ear;
Oh, rend the heavens, come quickly down,
And make our waiting hearts Thine own.

Command Thy blessing in this hour;
And as the Spirit full of pow'r
With life and vision full this place,
That all Thy purpose we may trace.

O Thou, our Head, our Life, our Guide,
May nought in life or death divide
The saints in Thy communion blessed,
That all Thy fulness be expressed.--------863
In daily walk and in our meetings too,
Christ is the center, Christ is everything;
'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,
But 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.

Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,
In Him we walk and by Him we are led;
Christ is the living water and the food;
Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.

Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify,
Christ is the life, 'tis Him we minister;
Christ is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify,
Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.

Christ is the All in all to God and man
With Him both we and God are satisfied;
Christ, the reality within the Church
By Him are life and numbers multiplied.

By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,
Christ the reality we would express;
All the activities in fellowship
Christ thus in operation manifest.

'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,
With nothing in our mind to formalize;
'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise,
And with Himself in spirit exercise.

All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,
Applying Him until maturity;
Let us count everything but loss for Him,
For Him, our All in all, eternally.--------864
Whene'er we meet with Christ endued,
The surplus of His plenitude
We offer unto God as food,
And thus exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

In Christ we live, by Christ we fight,
On Christ we labor day and night,
And with His surplus we unite
To thus exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

Our life and all we are and do
Is Christ Himself, the substance true,
That every time we meet anew
We may exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

In meetings Christ to God we bear
And Christ with one another share,
And Christ with God enjoying there,
We thus exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

The risen Christ to God we bring,
And Christ ascended offering,
God's satisfaction answering,
We thus exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

The center and reality,
The atmosphere and ministry,
Of all our meetings is that we
May thus exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

The testimony and the prayer,
And all the fellowship we share,
The exercise of gifts, whate'er,
Should just exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.

The Father we would glorify,
Exalting Christ the Son, thereby
The meeting's purpose satisfy
That we exhibit Christ.

  Let us exhibit Christ,
  Let us exhibit Christ;
  We'll bring His surplus to the church
  And thus exhibit Christ.--------865
In spirit and in truth, O Lord,
We meet to worship here;
As taught by Christ, the Son of God,
We now in Him draw near.

Thank God, He is a Spirit true,
So near, so dear to us;
That we may contact Him in life,
In truth to worship thus.

A spirit God has made for us
That we may worship Him,
Not striving, serving outwardly,
But seeking from within.

Regenerated by the Lord,
Renewed in mind and heart,
He dwells within us as our life
True worship to impart.

We worship here according to
The inner consciousness,
Anointed by His Spirit now
His fulness we express.

In truth we serve and worship too,
In shadows nevermore,
In Christ, the one reality,
The Father we adore.

To God we offer Christ the Lord
Whom we experience;
With God we too delight in Him,
His light and sweetness sense.

In spirit and reality
Together here we meet,
To worship, praise, and fellowship
Around the mercy-seat.--------866
Exercise the spirit!
Human thought reject;
Meet with one another,
Body life respect.

Exercise the spirit!
All the forms forsake;
Share with one another,
Each of Christ partake.

Exercise the spirit!
Natural sense renounce;
Serve with one another,
Christ the Lord announce.

Exercise the spirit!
Soulish life deny;
Helping one another,
On the Lord rely.

Freed within the spirit
From self-righteousness,
From self-condemnation,
And self-consciousness.

Freed within the spirit
From self-will and pride,
From self-love and glory,
All to override.

Exercise the spirit,
Victory to claim
By the blood which cleanses
And the mighty Name.

Exercise the spirit
Thus to touch the Lord;
Ever by the spirit
Take Him thru His Word.

It is by the spirit
Christ is testified;
It is by the spirit
Man is satisfied.

10 Exercise the spirit!
This is what we need!
Exercise the spirit!
May the Lord so lead!--------867
As members of the Body
Christ we would manifest,
Each learning how to function
His fulness to express;
We would not be spectators
But each as members move,
None bringing death or damage
But each our profit prove.

As in a team we'd never
Act independently,
But in coordination,
Each would dependent be;
Not acting by our choosing
But following the flow,
Distraction never bringing,
The Spirit's way we'd know.

On Christ we here would focus,
No other center make;
With Christ in sweet communion
His riches to partake.
He is our Head and content,
His Body we express;
Whate'er we do while meeting
Himself must manifest.

Built up in love together,
Not one would criticize;
To perfect one another,
We all would exercise.
Each one from self delivered,
The natural life forsakes;
In grace each trained in spirit
The Body-life partakes.--------868
Ere from our gathering we're dismissed, dear Lord,
We sing again to thank Thee from our heart,
For Thy dear presence and refreshing grace,
Which Thou so richly didst to us impart.

Though now the meeting's over, in Thy grace,
Thy presence never will from us depart;
But as the Spirit Thy sustaining strength
Thou wouldst in love unceasingly impart.

Lord, may Thy presence go with us, we pray,
To bear with us the burden on our heart,
That every moment we Thyself enjoy,
Till in the coming meeting we take part.--------869
Ere we depart, we praise Thee, Lord, again
For Thy dear presence and Thy living word;
We are attracted by Thy preciousness,
Our hearts incline to Thee through what we've heard.

Thy word is spirit and is life to us,
By it we're nourished, growing, Lord, in Thee;
Thus to Thine image we may be transformed,
With Thy full measure to maturity.

Impart Thyself to us, Lord, more and more,
And make us in the spirit walk and move,
That we be kept in fellowship with Thee,
Until we meet again, Thy grace to prove.--------870
Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
Ye soldiers of the cross;
Lift high His royal banner,
It must not suffer loss:
From vict'ry unto vict'ry
His army shall He lead,
Till every foe is vanquished
And Christ is Lord indeed.

  Stand up for Jesus
  Ye soldiers of the cross;
  Lift high His royal banner,
  It must not, it must not suffer loss.

Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
The trumpet call obey;
Forth to the mighty conflict
In this His glorious day.
Ye that are men, now serve Him
Against unnumbered foes;
Let courage rise with danger,
And strength to strength oppose.

  Stand up for Jesus
  Ye soldiers of the cross;
  Lift high His royal banner,
  It must not, it must not suffer loss.

Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
Stand in His strength alone;
The arm of flesh will fail you;
Ye dare not trust your own.
Put on the Gospel armor,
And, watching unto prayer,
Where duty calls, or danger,
Be never wanting there.

  Stand up for Jesus
  Ye soldiers of the cross;
  Lift high His royal banner,
  It must not, it must not suffer loss.

Stand up! Stand up for Jesus!
The strife will not be long:
This day the noise of battle,
The next the victor's song;
To him that overcometh
A crown of life shall be;
He, with the King of glory,
Shall reign eternally.

  Stand up for Jesus
  Ye soldiers of the cross;
  Lift high His royal banner,
  It must not, it must not suffer loss.--------871
Onward Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ, the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!

  Onward Christian soldiers!
  Marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  Going on before.

At the name of Jesus
Satan's host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell's foundations quiver
At the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise!

  Onward Christian soldiers!
  Marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  Going on before.

Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God:
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one Body we
One in faith and Spirit,
One eternally.

  Onward Christian soldiers!
  Marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  Going on before.

Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane;
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain.
Gates of hell can never
'Gainst the Church prevail;
We have Christ's own promise,
Which can never fail.

  Onward Christian soldiers!
  Marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  Going on before.

Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song.
Glory, laud and honor
Unto Christ, the King;
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.

  Onward Christian soldiers!
  Marching as to war,
  With the cross of Jesus
  Going on before.--------872
Fight the good fight with all thy might!
Christ is thy strength, and Christ thy right;
Lay hold on life, and it shall be
Thy joy and crown eternally.

Run the straight race through God's good grace,
Lift up thine eyes, and seek His face;
Life with its way before us lies,
Christ is the path, and Christ the prize.

Cast care aside, lean on thy Guide;
His boundless mercy will provide;
Trust, and thy trusting soul shall prove
Christ is its life, and Christ its love.

Faint not nor fear, His arms are near,
He changeth not, and thou art dear;
Only believe, and thou shalt see
That Christ is all in all to thee.--------873
Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
The conflict has begun;
Thy battle song triumphant
"The victory is won!"
Hell's power must be vanquished
And Satan's forces strewn;
The Captain of the Army
Will come and triumph soon.

Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
And gaze upon thy Lord;
If thou wilt fight His battle,
The throne is thy reward.
This war is of the spirit,
Not fought on earthly ground;
The Lord well knows the foe is near,
Encircling us around.

Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
Christ's throne awaiteth thee;
His resurrection power
Will lift thy spirit free.
Through Him thou wilt have power,
The foe to battle down;
Through Him thou wilt the triumph sing,
And wear the victor's crown.

Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
Thou shalt ascend the throne;
A feast He is preparing,
How happy thou to own.
With Him we're resurrected
Above the battle din;
Transcending all that binds us,
We're far above in Him.

Charge, soldiers, charge in battle!
Thou art the royal heir;
The Lord from dust did choose thee,
That thou His kingdom share.
Thou hast no part in darkness,
Thy future, O how bright;
With Christ to dwell forever
And in His love delight.

With joyful shouts charge forward!
The kingdom is before;
Upon the peak of Zion
We'll sing, the battle o'er.
The Lamb has won the victory!
The Lamb is on the throne!
With shouts of joy we praise Him,
For He must overcome.--------874
Standing in the evil day,
Heeding not what men may say,
Fearing not the face of clay,
Christian soldier, stand.

Standing for the Word of God,
Standing for the precious blood,
Following where the saints have trod,
Christian soldier, stand.

Stand 'mid Satan's every wile,
Stand 'mid pleasure's wanton smile,
Stand when error would beguile;
Christian soldier, stand.

Stand till ends life's little day,
Stand for Jesus, come what may,
Stand and fight and watch and pray;
Christian soldier, stand.--------875
'Tis easy when the morning
Appears at last to view
To praise thy strong Redeemer
Who burst the bondage through,
But 'tis the praise at midnight
That gives the foe alarm,
That glorifies thy Savior,
And bares His strong right arm.

If thou wouldst be a conqueror,
Yea, more than conqueror thou,
If thou wilt shout in triumph
And claim the victory now;
The prison-doors will open,
The dungeon gleam with light,
And sin-chained souls around thee
Shall see thy Lord's great might.--------876
When war is hot and fierce,
And Satan strong,
Then firmly trust God's Word
And sing faith's song.

You need to shout but once,
And you will win;
Oh, do not shut your mouth
And lose therein.

If pressed your spirit is
And powerless,
Pray thru the precious blood,
Victorious.

The foe though fierce, you can
Still fight with him;
If you will keep your stand,
You soon will win.

Therefore you must declare
Christ's victory;
The situation dark
Soon changed will be.--------877
I dare not be defeated
With Calvary in view,
Where Jesus conquered Satan,
Where all His foes He slew;
Come, Lord, and give the vision
To nerve me for the fight,
Make me an overcomer
Clothed with Thy Spirit's might.

  A victor, a victor!
  Because of Calvary.
  Make me an overcomer,
  A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.

I dare not be defeated
Since Christ, my conquering King
Has called me to the battle
Which He did surely win.
Come, Lord, and give me courage,
Thy conquering Spirit give,
Make me an overcomer,
In power within me live.

  A victor, a victor!
  Because of Calvary.
  Make me an overcomer,
  A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.

I dare not be defeated,
When Jesus leads me on
To press through hellish regions
To share with Him His Throne;
Come, Lord, and give Thy soldier
The power to wield the sword,
Make me an overcomer
Through Thine inerrant Word.

  A victor, a victor!
  Because of Calvary.
  Make me an overcomer,
  A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.

I dare not be defeated,
Just at the set of sun,
When Jesus waits to whisper,
"Well done, beloved, well done";
Come, Lord, bend from the Glory,
On me Thy Spirit cast,
Make me an overcomer,
A victor to the last.

  A victor, a victor!
  Because of Calvary.
  Make me an overcomer,
  A conqu'ror, a conqu'ror, Lord, in Thee.--------878
Conquering now and still to conquer,
Rideth a King in His might,
Leading the host of all the faithful
Into the midst of the fight;
See them with courage advancing,
Clad in their brilliant array,
Shouting the name of their Leader,
Hear them exultingly say:

  "Not to the strong is the battle,
  Not to the swift is the race;
  Yet to the true and the faithful
  Vict'ry is promised through grace."

Conquering now and still to conquer,
Who is this wonderful King?
Whence are the armies which He leadeth
While of His glory they sing?
He is our Lord and Redeemer,
Savior and Monarch divine;
They are the stars that forever
Bright in His kingdom will shine.

  "Not to the strong is the battle,
  Not to the swift is the race;
  Yet to the true and the faithful
  Vict'ry is promised through grace."

Conquering now and still to conquer,
Jesus, Thou Ruler of all,
Thrones and their scepters all shall perish,
Crowns and their splendor shall fall,
Yet shall the armies Thou leadest
Faithful and true to the last,
Find in Thy kingdom eternal
Rest, when their warfare is past.

  "Not to the strong is the battle,
  Not to the swift is the race;
  Yet to the true and the faithful
  Vict'ry is promised through grace."--------879
Christian, dost thou see them
On the holy ground,
How the powers of darkness
Compass thee around?
Christian, up and smite them,
Counting gain but loss;
Smite them by the merit
Of the holy cross.

Christian, dost thou feel them,
How they work within,
Striving, tempting, luring,
Goading into sin?
Christian, never tremble,
Never be downcast;
Gird thee for the conflict;
Watch, and pray, and fast.

Christian, dost thou hear them,
How they speak thee fair?
"Always fast and vigil,
Always watch and prayer?"
Christian, answer boldly,
"While I breathe I pray";
Peace shall follow battle,
Night shall end in day.--------880
To the foe my word is always, "No,"
To the Father it is, "Yes,"
That His plan and all His counsel
Be accomplished with success;
When Thine orders I'm obeying,
Grant me, Lord, authority
To fulfill Thy plan eternal
Thru the Spirit's power in me.

To the foe my word is always, "No,"
To the Father it is, "Yes,"
'Tis my attitude eternal;
May the Lord protect and bless,
Lest while walking in obedience
Satan undermine the way;
When I'm list'ning to Thine orders,
Grant me mercy, Lord, I pray.

To the foe my word is always, "No,"
To the Father it is, "Yes,";
I completely would obey Him,
Though deep suff'ring may oppress.
If the Lord will save and keep me,
As I forward press with Him,
Then no trials shall prevent me,
Nor will opposition grim.--------881
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender;
We go not forth alone against the foe;
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

Yea, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!
In Thy dear Name, all other names above;
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.

We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,
And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender:
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise
When reigning in the Kingdom of Thy splendor,
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.--------882
Encamped along the hills of light,
Ye Christian soldiers rise,
And press the battle ere the night
Shall veil the glowing skies;
Against the foe in vales below
Let all our strength be hurled;
Faith is the victory, we know,
That overcomes the world.

  Faith is the victory!
  Faith is the victory!
  O glorious victory,
  That overcomes the world.

His banner over us is love,
Our sword the Word of God;
We tread the road the saints before
With shouts of triumph trod.
By faith, they like a whirlwind's breath,
Swept on o'er every field;
The faith by which they conquered death
Is still our shining shield.

  Faith is the victory!
  Faith is the victory!
  O glorious victory,
  That overcomes the world.

On every hand the foe we find
Drawn up in dread array;
Let tents of ease be left behind,
And onward to the fray.
Salvation's helmet on each head,
With truth all girt about,
The earth shall tremble 'neath our tread,
And echo with our shout.

  Faith is the victory!
  Faith is the victory!
  O glorious victory,
  That overcomes the world.

To him that overcomes the foe,
White raiment shall be giv'n;
Before the angels he shall know
His name confessed in heav'n;
Then onward from the hills of light,
Our hearts with love aflame,
We'll vanquish all the hosts of night,
In Jesus' conqu'ring name.

  Faith is the victory!
  Faith is the victory!
  O glorious victory,
  That overcomes the world.--------883
In the Overcomer's Name
Be an overcomer too!
Stand and put the foe to shame
All the livelong battle through!

Jesus is the Name to sound,
Name to rally fainting hearts!
To recapture "forfeit" ground,
Lost awhile through Satan's arts.

Backward drive the Evil One!
Force him out of every hold;
Smite until the sinking sun
Sets upon the warrior bold!

In the Overcomer's Name
Be an overcomer too!
Stand and put the foe to shame
All the livelong battle through!--------884
The Son of God goes forth to war,
A kingly crown to gain;
His blood-red banner streams afar:
Who follows in His train?
Who best can drink his cup of woe,
Triumphant over pain,
Who patient bears his cross below,
He follows in His train.

The martyr first, whose eagle eye
Could pierce beyond the grave,
Who saw his Master in the sky,
And called to Him to save:
Like Him, with pardon on his tongue,
In midst of mortal pain,
He prayed for them that did the wrong:
Who follows in his train?

A glorious band, the chosen few
On whom the Spirit came,
Twelve valiant saints, their hope they knew,
And mocked the cross and flame.
They met the tyrant's brandished steel,
The lion's gory mane,
They bowed their necks, the death to feel:
Who follows in their train?

A noble army, men and boys,
The matron and the maid,
Around the Savior's throne rejoice,
In robes of light arrayed.
They climbed by strength divine from heaven,
Through peril, toil, and pain:
O God, to us may grace be given
To follow in their train.--------885
Fight the battle in the Body,
Never fight it on your own;
With the Body to the Head joined,
Fight the battle on the throne.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

For the Body is God's armor,
Not for anyone alone;
When you wrestle in the Body,
All its benefits you own.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

'Tis the Church on Christ established
Satan shall not overpow'r;
'Tis the Body built together
Which resists the evil pow'r.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

In the Body, by the Headship,
Sitting in the heavenlies,
Struggle with the wicked spirits
And the principalities.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

As a member of the Body,
With the brethren stand for God;
Praying always in the Spirit,
Claim the vict'ry through the Blood.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

In the heav'nlies more than conqu'ror,
In the power of His might,
As a soldier in the army,
In the Lord the battle fight.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.

Keep on wrestling in the Body,
Mighty vict'ry you will see,
Bind and loose, God's will fulfilling,
And the foes your food will be.

  Fight the battle in the Body!
  By the virtue of the Head;
  Standing firmly with the Body,
  Into vict'ry you'll be led.--------886
In verse 2, noun "Sabaoth"
(plural) hosts or armies; used in the book of Romans in the New Testament
"Lord of Sabaoth"

A mighty Fortress is our God,
A Bulwark never failing;
Our Helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God's own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth His Name,
From age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us:
The Prince of Darkness grim,
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

That word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God's truth abideth still,
His Kingdom is forever.--------887
The name of Jesus is our stand,
It is our victory;
Not on ourselves do we rely,
But, mighty Lord, on Thee.
Our weapons are not arms of flesh,
But ours the Spirit's sword,
And God's whole armor putting on,
We battle in the Lord.

Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,
Stand firm in one accord!
Though war be fierce and darkness thick,
Resist him in the Lord!
If one thru fear should backward turn,
He undermines the rest.
Oh, do not let your brothers down,
Nor by you be distressed.

The devil knows his time is short,
He is the more enraged,
And by his wiles would weaken us
Before the battle's waged.
The trials now more numerous are,
The suff'ring e'en more sore,
The force of hell opposing us
More dreadful than before.

What should our posture be today
In such a desperate hour?
Should we our ease and pleasure seek
And let the foe devour?
Or with increasing conflict strong,
Courageous to endure?
'Tis here that life or death is won!
Who will God's praise secure?

For Christ the Lord we then would stand,
He is the Conqueror!
For Him we would endure the pain
Until the fight is o'er.
The hour of triumph soon we'll see
The Lord will come again;
If now we suffer for His sake,
Then we with Him shall reign.--------888
Soldiers of Christ, arise,
And put your armor on,
Strong in the strength which God supplies,
Through His eternal Son;
Strong in the Lord of Hosts,
And in His mighty pow'r,
Who in the strength of Jesus trusts
Is more than conqueror.

Stand then in His great might,
With all His strength endued;
And take, to arm you for the fight,
The panoply of God,
That, having all things done,
And all your conflicts past,
Ye may o'ercome through Christ alone,
And stand complete at last.

Leave no unguarded place,
No weakness of the soul,
Take every virtue, every grace,
And fortify the whole.
To keep your armor bright
Attend with constant care,
Still walking in your Captain's sight
And watching unto prayer.

Pray, without ceasing pray,
Your Captain gives the word;
His summons cheerfully obey,
And call upon the Lord:
To God your every want
In instant prayer display;
Pray always; pray, and never faint;
Pray, without ceasing pray.

From strength to strength go on;
Wrestle, and fight, and pray;
Tread all the powers of darkness down
And win the well-fought day:
Still let the Spirit cry
In all His soldiers, "Come!"
Till Christ the Lord descend from high,
And take the conquerors home.--------889

  Over every foe.--------891
O Lord, to conflict new
You daily call your servant;
With joy and spirits fervent
We rise to follow You.
Lead us to battle too,
We are Your soldiers true.

  Our hands empow'r,
  Our hearts enflame!
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name,
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name!
  Our hands empow'r, our hearts enflame!

Fully equip us, Lord,
With faith and perseverance,
With wisdom and adherence,
With zeal and love outpoured;
Set us on fire, O Lord,
To win the great reward.

  Our hands empow'r,
  Our hearts enflame!
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name,
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name!
  Our hands empow'r, our hearts enflame!

We lift up firm and high
The Cross, our banner glorious.
The enemy notorious
By Blood we dare defy.
To self the Cross apply,
On Christ alone rely.

  Our hands empow'r,
  Our hearts enflame!
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name,
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name!
  Our hands empow'r, our hearts enflame!

  Our hands empow'r,
  Our hearts enflame!
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name,
  We'll overcome in Jesus' name!
  Our hands empow'r, our hearts enflame!--------892
With all the pow'r in heav'n and earth
Our resurrected Lord's endued;
If we unite and live by Him,
The enemy will be subdued.

In Jesus' name we must declare
That we shall overcome the foe;
We draw authority from Him
The serpent's head to crush below.

No matter what, thou mountain high,
In heav'n or earth, where'er thou art,
At any cost we'll level thee,
In Jesus' name thou must depart!

Faith orders thee "Remove from here,
And be thou cast into the sea!"
We should, we must, we can, we will,
Fulfill God's purpose faithfully.--------893
Conflict today is fierce,
The strength of Satan more;
The cry of battle calling now
Is louder than before.
The rebel voice of hell
E'en stronger now becomes;
But list, the midnight cry resounds,
Behold, I quickly come!

Trials more bitter grow,
The fighting doth enlarge;
Hell's forces rally all their pow'rs
And gather for the charge.
Yet while we wait and watch
And feel the war severe,
We hear the joyful song ring out,
Jesus, the Lord, is near!

'Tis harder at the end
The word to testify,
For Satan fights with all his pow'r
Our witness to defy.
Much greater strength we need
The foe to overcome;
How happy when the Lord we see
And all our sighing's done!

Who then will forward go
Strong in His mighty power?
Who then will firmly trust the Lord
Until the vict'ry hour;
Till with the conqu'rors blest,
The triumph song's begun?
That man will then rejoice to hear,
Behold, I quickly come!

Who then will choose God's best,
And take the narrow track,
Though passing thru the wildest storms,
Yet never turning back?
Who now will dare press on,
Enduring pain and fear?
All such will then rejoice to see
Jesus, the Lord, is near!

Though deep the darkness be
We still would onward go,
Till we the day of rapture greet
And glory 'round shall glow.
'Tis there we'll see the Lord,
And Satan overcome;
The overcomers will rejoice,
Jesus, the Lord, has come!--------894
Will you be an overcomer?
Christ is calling now!
Will you then be such a follower,
Though you know not how?

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
To the Lord be drawn!
Keep the "first love," never leave it,
Till the break of dawn.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
On His life depend!
Dare to suffer persecution,
Faithful to the end.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
Testimony bear!
Keep away from false religion,
"Hidden manna" share.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer,
Simple, real, and pure?
Overcome all evil mixture,
Ruling pow'r secure.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
Trust the living Lord!
Keep your "garments" from the deadness,
Win the life-reward.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
Never lukewarm be,
Ne'er content with what you've gotten,
More you need to see.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!

Will you be an overcomer?
Christ is calling still!
Will you now be loyal to Him,
His demand fulfill.

  Will you be an overcomer?
  Will you make this choice?
  Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
  Listen to His voice!--------895
To the work! To the work! We are servants of God,
Let us follow the path that our Master has trod;
With the might of His power our strength to renew,
Let us do by His grace what He calls us to do.

  Work for Him by His grace;
  Work thru Him for His praise;
  Work with Him all the days;
  And work in Him in many ways.

To the work! To the work! Let the hungry be fed;
To the fountain of life let the thirsty be led;
In the cross and its vict'ry our glory shall be,
While we herald the tidings, "Salvation is free!"

  Work for Him by His grace;
  Work thru Him for His praise;
  Work with Him all the days;
  And work in Him in many ways.

To the work! To the work! In the strength of the Lord,
By the pow'r of His Name, with the light of His Word,
All the slaves of the darkness of Satan set free
And His riches of grace in His glory we'll see.

  Work for Him by His grace;
  Work thru Him for His praise;
  Work with Him all the days;
  And work in Him in many ways.--------896
Go, labor on; spend, and be spent;
Thy joy to do the Father's will;
It is the way the Master went;
Should not the servant tread it still?

Go, labor on: 'tis not for nought;
Thy earthly loss is heav'nly gain;
Men heed thee, love thee, praise thee not;
The Master praises, what are men?

Go, labor on: your hands are weak,
Your knees are faint, your souls cast down;
Yet falter not; the prize you seek
Is near, a kingdom and a crown.

Go, labor on while it is day,
The world's dark night is hastening on;
Speed, speed thy work, cast sloth away,
It is not thus that souls are won.

Men die in darkness at your side,
Without a hope to cheer the tomb;
Take up the torch and wave it wide,
The torch that lights time's thickest gloom.

Press on, faint not, keep watch and pray;
Be wise the erring soul to win;
Go forth into the world's highway,
Compel the wanderer to come in.

Press on, and in thy work rejoice;
For work comes rest, the prize thus won;
Soon shalt thou hear the Master's voice,
The midnight cry, Behold, I come!--------897
Work, for the Day is coming,
Day in the Word foretold,
When, 'mid the scenes triumphant,
Longed for by saints of old,
He, who on earth a stranger
Traversed its paths of pain,
Jesus, the Prince, the Savior,
Comes evermore to reign.

Work, for the Day is coming,
Darkness will soon be gone;
Then o'er the night of weeping
Day without end shall dawn,
What now we sow in sadness
Then we shall reap in joy;
Hope will be changed to gladness,
Praise be our blest employ.

Work, for the Day is coming,
Made for the saints of light;
Off with the garments dreary,
On with the armor bright:
Soon will the strife be ended,
Soon all our toils below;
Not to the dark we're tending,
But to the Day we go.

Work, for the Lord is coming,
Children of light are we;
From Jesus' bright appearing
Powers of darkness flee.
Out of the mist, at His bidding,
Souls like the dew are born:
O'er all the East are spreading
Tints of the rosy morn.

Work, then, the Day is coming,
No time for sighing now;
Prize for the race awaits thee,
Wreaths for the victor's brow.
Now morning Light is breaking,
Soon will the Day appear;
Night shades appall no longer,
Jesus, our Lord, is near.--------898
The love of Christ constraineth;
Oh, let the watchword ring
Till all the world adoring
To Jesus' feet it bring.
Till north and south the kingdoms
Shall own His glorious sway,
And east and west the nations
Rejoice to see His Day.

The love of Christ constraineth;
At home, abroad, where'er
By sea or shore abiding
His Name and mark we bear.
We ask not that our service
Or great or small may be,
If only Thou wilt own it,
Dear Lord, as unto Thee.

The love of Christ constraineth;
And we who trust His Word,
Who know and feel its power
To gladder service stirred,
Shall neither faint nor falter,
Though dark the night and long,
And weak our hands that labor;
His strength shall make us strong.

The love of Christ constraineth,
Then let us work and pray,
And watch the glad appearing
Of that triumphant day,
When Father, Son, and Spirit,
By every tongue confessed,
All earth His broad dominion
In His dear love shall rest.--------899
The work is Thine, O Christ our Lord,
The cause for which we stand;
And being Thine, 'twill overcome
Its foe on every hand.
Yet grains of wheat, before they grow,
Are buried in the earth below;
All that is old doth perish there
To form a life both new and fair:
So too are we from self and sin made free.

Through suff'ring Thou, O Christ, didst go
Unto Thy throne above,
And leadest now the selfsame way
Those true in faith and love;
So lead us, then, though suff'rings wait,
To share Thy kingdom's heav'nly state;
Thy death has broken Satan's might,
And leads the faithful to the light;
Eternal light, from darkness into light.

Thou hast, O Savior, led the way
Through agony and death;
O give, we pray, yet more and more
Thy Spirit's living breath!
Send messengers o'er land and sea
To bring Thy children all to Thee;
Thy name can save, Thy name makes free;
We consecrate ourselves to Thee
As servants true, as warriors brave and true.--------900
Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Only to lie at His feet,
A broken and emptied vessel
For the Master's use made meet!
Emptied that He might fill me
As forth to His service I go;
Broken, that so unhindered,
His life through me might flow.

  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
  Only to lie at His feet,
  A broken and emptied vessel
  For the Master's use made meet!

Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Only as led by His hand
A messenger at His gateway,
Only waiting for His command;
Only an instrument ready
His praises to sound at His will
Willing, should He not require me,
In silence to wait on Him still.

  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
  Only to lie at His feet,
  A broken and emptied vessel
  For the Master's use made meet!

Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
Painful the humbling may be!
Yet low in the dust I'd lay me
That the world might my Savior see!
Rather be nothing, nothing!
To Him let their voices be raised!
He is the fountain of blessing,
He only is meet to be praised!

  Oh, to be nothing, nothing!
  Only to lie at His feet,
  A broken and emptied vessel
  For the Master's use made meet!--------901
Lord, how can man e'er preach Thy Word?
He is brittle, crazy glass;
Yet in Thy temple is conferred
This glorious and transcendent place,
To be window through Thy grace.

But when Thou dost anneal Thy story
In glass, Thy life to shine within
The holy preachers, light of glory
More radiant grows and more doth win,
Which else shows waterish, bleak, and thin.

The life and doctrine blent in one
As light and color mingled, bring
A strong regard; but speech alone
Doth vanish like a flaring thing,
And in the ear, not spirit ring.--------902
Shine Thou upon us, Lord,
True Light of men, today,
And through the written Word
Thy very self display;
That so from hearts which burn
With gazing on Thy face,
Thy little ones may learn
The wonders of Thy grace.

Breathe Thou upon us, Lord,
Thy Spirit's living flame,
That so with one accord
Our lips may tell Thy name;
Give Thou the hearing ear,
Fix Thou the wandering thought,
That those we teach may hear
The great things Thou hast wrought.

Speak Thou for us, O Lord,
In all we say of Thee;
According to Thy Word
Let all our teaching be;
That so Thy lambs may know
Their own true Shepherd's voice,
Where'er He lead them go,
And in His love rejoice.

Live Thou within us, Lord;
Thy mind and will be ours;
Be Thou beloved, adored,
And served with all our powers;
That so our lives may teach
Thy children what Thou art,
And plead, by more than speech,
For Thee with every heart.--------903
Lord, speak to me, that I may speak
In living echoes of Thy tone;
As Thou hast sought, so let me seek
Thy erring children lost and lone.

O lead me, Lord, that I may lead
The wandering and the wavering feet;
O feed me, Lord, that I may feed
Thy hungering ones with manna sweet.

O strengthen me, that while I stand
Firm on the rock, and strong in Thee,
I may stretch out a loving hand
To wrestlers with the troubled sea.

O teach me, Lord, that I may teach
The precious things Thou dost impart;
And wing my words, that they may reach
The hidden depths of many a heart.

O give Thine own sweet rest to me,
That I may speak with soothing power
A word in season, as from Thee
To weary ones in needful hour.

O fill me with Thy fulness, Lord,
Until my very heart o'erflow
In kindling thought and glowing word,
Thy love to tell, Thy praise to show.

O use me, Lord, use even me,
Just as Thou wilt, and when, and where,
Until Thy blessed face I see,
Thy rest, Thy joy, Thy glory share!--------904
We have a most glorious King;
The heavens, He says, are His throne;
All worlds are His mighty domain,
All kingdoms His scepter shall own.
He dwells with His people below,
He loves in their trials to share;
We dwell with the King for His work,
His burden we willingly bear.

I'm dwelling with Jesus my King;
I've found where He dwells with His own;
I've opened the door of my heart;
He's made it His temple and throne.
Like Mary I sit at His feet,
Like John I recline on His breast;
His presence is fulness of joy,
His bosom is infinite rest.

I dwell with the King for His work,
I've part in His glorious plan
To bring in His kingdom to earth
And tell His salvation to man.
The world has its work and rewards,
I count them but folly and loss;
My business is only His work,
My message is only His cross.

I dwell with the King for His work,
The work, it is His and not mine;
He plans and prepares it for me
And fills me with power divine.
So duty is changed to delight,
And prayer into praise as I sing;
I dwell with my King for His work
And work in the strength of my King.

We'll dwell with the King for His work
And work thru each day of the year.
Perhaps ere it passes, the King
In glory Himself shall appear.
Oh, then in some closer embrace,
Oh, then in some nobler employ
We'll dwell with the King for His work
In endless, ineffable joy!--------905
O Master, let me walk with Thee
In lowly paths of service free;
Tell me Thy secret, help me bear
The strain of toil, the fret of care.

Help me the slow of heart to move
By some clear, winning word of love;
Teach me the wayward feet to stay,
And guide them in the Godward way.

Teach me Thy patience; still with Thee
In closer, dearer company,
In work that keeps faith sweet and strong,
In trust that triumphs over wrong.

In hope that sends a shining ray
Far down the future's broad'ning way,
In peace that only Thou canst give,
With Thee, O Master, let me live.--------906
How much can we do for our Savior?
How much for our dear fellow man?
The way to do more than we're able
Is Jesus within to enable;
Thus we can do more than we can.

How much can we be for our Savior
In life with its brief, fleeting span?
If Jesus within us is dwelling
Our life and our actions infilling,
We all can do more than we can.

How much can we bear for our Savior?
How much for our dear fellow man?
If in us His love is constraining,
If 'neath us His arms are sustaining,
We all can do more than we can.

How much can we give for our Savior?
To succor our dear fellow man?
If from us His love is o'erflowing,
Our life will be ever outgoing;
We'll always do more than we can.--------907
Not where we elect to go,
But where Jesus leads the way,
There the living waters flow,
There our darkness turns to day.

Not our self-appointed task
Will the Lord's approval win,
But the work we did not ask,
Finished humbly, just for Him.

Not the prayer we long to plead
When we bend before the Throne,
But the touching deeper need
Of the Spirit's wordless groan.

Not the gift we proudly lay
On His altar will He heed,
If our hearts have said Him, "Nay,"
When He whispered, "I have need."

Thus we die, and dying live
In the heavenlies with the Lord;
Thus we serve, and pray, and give,
Christ Himself our great Reward.--------908
Not of letters, but of spirit,
The New Testament way;
For 'tis life the spirit giveth,
But the letters always slay.
Outward work God never reckons,
But what's from the inmost part;
It is not to serve in letter,
But life's newness to impart.

Not just by the outward teachings,
But by His anointing moved;
Not just by the outward pattern,
But by inward vision proved.
Not by human rules or rituals,
But by heaven's rule within;
Not by human-made decisions,
But by guidance giv'n of Him.

Not a dead religion serving,
But in Christ as life to live;
Not theology dispensing,
But a living Christ to give.
Not the knowledge of mere doctrine,
But the message Christ should be;
Not the gifts, the forms, the teachings,
But God's Christ  reality.

Not objectively to worship,
But to serve Him inwardly;
Not to preach a Christ objective,
But Himself subjectively.
Not just by the Scripture serving,
But in spirit and in life;
Not by flesh, but by the Spirit
Filling, freeing from all strife.--------909
In the stream! In the stream! Let us work for the Lord,
By His mind, in His way, as revealed in His Word;
In the flow of His life let us work with His pow'r
For His Kingdom and Church in the time of His hour.

  In the stream! In the stream!
  Let us work in the stream!
  In the stream! In the stream!
  We'll work as in the heav'nly team!

In the stream! In the stream! Let us work with the Lord
In the flow of the Spirit, as taught by His Word;
Never working by self, independent and free,
But in service related in full harmony.

  In the stream! In the stream!
  Let us work in the stream!
  In the stream! In the stream!
  We'll work as in the heav'nly team!

In the stream! In the stream! Let us work in the Lord,
With the Church, with the saints, in the light of His Word;
Give the Word, life supply to the people in need,
Thus fulfilling God's plan, in His flow we'll proceed.

  In the stream! In the stream!
  Let us work in the stream!
  In the stream! In the stream!
  We'll work as in the heav'nly team!--------910
The overflow of life is work,
The work should be our living!
What we experience e'er should be
The message we are giving.
When living and the work are one,
The work will be effectual;
When message and the life are one,
The word will be successful.

The work must be the fruit of life,
Born thru the Spirit's flowing;
As branches of the Lord, the vine,
Fruit bearing, life bestowing.
'Tis Christ Himself thru us to work,
Himself as life expressing,
And all the riches of His life
To others manifesting.

'Tis not a movement borne of man,
But by His power moving;
'Tis not the deeds done outwardly,
But inward action proving.
'Tis not the work of enterprise,
But 'tis His life confessing;
'Tis not to toil for our success,
But 'tis Himself expressing.

Our plans, our aims, our energy
We must abandon wholly,
That He may work His plan thru us,
His aim and object solely.
Ourselves, with all we are and have,
To death we must surrender,
That Christ may live Himself thru us
With riches and with splendor.--------911
O how blessed is the priest's life,
Christ to him is all in all:
All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
And His portion therewithal.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.

All the clothing of his service
Is the beauty of the Lord;
Glorious splendor do his garments,
Breast and shoulder-piece afford.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.

When in sacrifice he offers
Christ to God as God has willed,
Then as food he doth enjoy Him
And is with His riches filled.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.

Putting on the Lord as clothing,
Christ without he doth express;
Eating, drinking, with Him mingled,
Christ within doth him possess.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.

Holy, glorious is their dwelling,
'Tis the increase of the Lord;
Here the priests built up together
Unto God a house afford.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.

All his portion, all his living,
Everything the priests possess
All is Christ and Christ forever,
In His all-inclusiveness.

  O how blessed is the priest's life,
  Christ to him is all in all:
  All His clothing, food, and dwelling,
  And His portion therewithal.--------912
Christ to minister is service
Both to God and others too,
Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
Off'ring Him as service true.

  Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.

As the Israelites did offer
From the surplus of their land,
Thus some produce reaped of Jesus
Must be in our serving hand.

  Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.

We on Christ, as land, must labor,
Harvest Him for all our fare;
Tasting Him to overflowing,
Christ with others we may share.

  Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.

Holding Christ, as members growing,
Each his function must observe;
Christ receiving, Christ partaking,
To His Body Christ we serve.

  Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.

Fellowship and testimony,
Ministry and worship too,
In all helps and ministrations
Christ is all our service true.

  Christ to minister is service
  Both to God and others too,
  Christ, the surplus, e'er supplying,
  Off'ring Him as service true.--------913
Serve and work within the Body,
This the Lord doth signify;
For His purpose is the Body,
And with it we must comply.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

As the members we've been quickened
Not as individuals free;
We must always serve together,
All related mutually.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

Living stones, we're built together
And a house for God must be,
As the holy priesthood serving,
In a blessed harmony.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

Thus we must be built together,
In position minister;
For the basis of our service
Is the body character.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

In our ministry and service,
From the Body, our supply;
If detached and isolated,
Out of function we will die.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

'Tis by serving in the Body
Riches of the Head we share;
'Tis by functioning as members
Christ's full measure we will bear.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

To the Head fast holding ever,
That we may together grow,
From the Head supplies incoming
Thru us to the Body flow.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.

Lord, anew we give our bodies;
May we be transformed to prove
All Thy will, to know Thy Body,
And therein to serve and move.

  Serve and work within the Body,
  Never independently;
  As the members of the Body,
  Functioning relatedly.--------914
For the Church should be our service,
'Tis the perfect will of God;
'Tis the only way of working
Which the Lord's apostles trod.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

For 'tis God's eternal purpose
That the Church His vessel be;
He intends that all our service
Build His Church continually.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

All the gifted persons given
To the Body by the Head
Are to aid the Church's building,
That to fulness she be led.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

All the gifts and all the functions,
All the spirit's power shown,
All the ministries are given
For the Church and that alone.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

All the preaching of the Gospel,
All the teaching ministry,
Every other kind of service
For the Church alone should be.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

Ministry is for the Churches,
Not the Church for ministry;
All the lampstands are the Churches,
Not a form of ministry.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

This will keep the Church's oneness,
Saving us from every sect;
This will ever test our motives,
And our aim will thus correct.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.

Lord, deliver us from our work,
From the work of any sect;
For Thy Church alone we'd labor
And its building up effect.

  For the Church should be our service,
  Not our aims to satisfy;
  This the perfect will of God is,
  And with it we must comply.--------915
From Greenland's icy mountains,
From India's coral strand,
Where Afric's sunny fountains
Roll down their golden sand;
From many an ancient river,
From many a palmy plain,
They call us to deliver
Their land from error's chain.

What though the spicy breezes
Blow soft on Ceylon's isle;
Though every prospect pleases,
And only man is vile;
In vain with lavish kindness
The gifts of God are strown;
The heathen, in his blindness,
Bows down to wood and stone.

Can we, whose souls are lighted
With wisdom from on high;
Can we to men benighted
The lamp of life deny?
Salvation! O salvation!
The joyful sound proclaim,
Till each remotest nation
Has learned Messiah's name.

Waft, waft, ye winds, His story;
And you, ye waters, roll,
Till, like a sea of glory,
It spreads from pole to pole;
Till o'er our ransomed nature,
The Lamb for sinners slain,
Redeemer, King, Creator,
In bliss returns to reign.--------916
Now the Lord our souls has fed,
With Himself, the Living Bread;
Fed us, sitting at His feet,
With the finest of the wheat.

We have endless treasure found;
We have all things and abound;
Rich abundance and to spare;
Shall we not the blessing share?

For, while we are feasting here,
Starving millions, far and near,
Call us with the bitter cry:
Come and help us, or we die.

In this day of full increase,
Shall we, can we, hold our peace?
Staying here we do not well;
Now then, let us go and tell:

Tell how He hath set us free,
How He leads triumphantly;
How He satisfies our need;
How His rest is rest indeed.

Speak, for we, Thy servants, hear;
Thou hast taught us not to fear;
And whate'er Thy word shall be,
We can do it, Lord, in Thee.--------917
Far, far away, in heathen darkness dwelling,
Millions of souls forever may be lost;
Who, who will go, salvation's story telling,
Looking to Jesus, counting not the cost?

  "All pow'r is given unto me,
  All pow'r is given unto me,
  Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
  And lo, I am with you alway."

See o'er the world, wide open doors inviting:
Soldiers of Christ, arise and enter in!
Christians, awake! Your forces all uniting,
Send forth the Gospel, break the chains of sin.

  "All pow'r is given unto me,
  All pow'r is given unto me,
  Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
  And lo, I am with you alway."

"Why will ye die?" the voice of God is calling,
"Why will ye die?" re-echo in His name:
Jesus hath died to save from death appalling,
Life and salvation therefore go proclaim.

  "All pow'r is given unto me,
  All pow'r is given unto me,
  Go ye into all the world and preach the gospel,
  And lo, I am with you alway."--------918
Christians, make haste, your mission high fulfilling,
To tell to all the world that God is Light,
That He who made all nation is not willing
One soul should perish, lost in shades of night.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

Behold how many thousands still are lying,
Bound in the darksome prison-house of sin,
With none to tell them of the Savior's dying
Or of the life He died for them to win.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

'Tis yours to save from peril of perdition
The soul for whom the Lord His life laid down;
Beware lest, slothful to fulfill your mission,
You lose one jewel that should deck His crown.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

Proclaim to every people, tongue, and nation
That God, in whom they move and live, is love;
Tell how He stooped to save His lost creation,
And died on earth that men He might approve.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

Give of your sons to bear the message glorious;
Give of your wealth to speed them on their way;
Pour out your soul for them in prayer victorious,
And all you spend our Savior will repay.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.

He comes again; O brothers, ere you meet Him,
Make known to every heart His saving grace;
Let none whom He hath ransomed fail to greet Him,
Through your neglect unfit to see His face.

  Publish glad tidings, tidings of peace;
  Tidings of Jesus, redemption and release.--------919
He shall reign o'er all the earth,
He who wore the crown of thorn,
Whom they deemed of little worth,
Whom they met with hate and scorn;
Send the tidings forth, that all
Humbly at His feet may fall.

Long His heritage hath lain
'Neath the false usurper's sway;
He will claim it back again,
Rout the foes and win the day.
Send the tidings forth, that all
Humbly at His feet may fall.

Then, beneath His rule of peace
Heaven shall smile, and earth shall sing,
Ever yielding rich increase
To the honor of her King.
Send the tidings forth, that all
Humbly at His feet may fall.

Hasten, Lord, the wondrous hour,
Bid it strike from shore to shore,
Thine the kingdom and the power,
Thine the glory evermore.
Bow each rebel heart, that all
At Thy feet adoring fall.--------920
Sound ye the trumpet-call;
Heralds proclaim
Jesus as Lord of all,
Sound forth His fame;
Tell of His great renown,
Lift high the kingly crown,
Let every knee bow down
At His blest name.

Who will go forth for Him?
Who will arise?
Though eyes with tears are dim,
Severed love's ties:
Counting all things but loss,
Earth's highest gain but dross,
And glorying in the cross,
Who will arise?

Go, for the crowning day
Draws ever near;
Time will soon pass away,
Jesus be here:
Raise ye the cross where now
Nations to idols bow;
Dawn o'er the mountain's brow
Tells He is near.

Hark to the trumpet-blast!
Jesus is King!
He comes to reign at last,
All conquering:
Then the wide world shall own,
Bending before His throne,
Jesus is King alone,
Jesus is King!--------921
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o'er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.

  Rescue the perishing,
  Care for the dying;
  Jesus is merciful,
  Jesus will save.

Though they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

  Rescue the perishing,
  Care for the dying;
  Jesus is merciful,
  Jesus will save.

Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.

  Rescue the perishing,
  Care for the dying;
  Jesus is merciful,
  Jesus will save.

Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand'rer a Savior has died.

  Rescue the perishing,
  Care for the dying;
  Jesus is merciful,
  Jesus will save.--------922
To the lost world minister Christ,
Not just by word, but by life,
Imparting Christ by living deeds
To the poor souls living in strife.

  To the lost world minister Christ,
  By daily walk making Him known;
  Imparting Christ by whom you live,
  Share with all men what you own.

To the lost world minister Christ,
The precious One you possess,
Imparting Christ to those you love
As all their gain and success.

  To the lost world minister Christ,
  By daily walk making Him known;
  Imparting Christ by whom you live,
  Share with all men what you own.

To the lost world minister Christ,
The very Christ you enjoy,
Imparting Christ to all your friends
As all their boast and their joy.

  To the lost world minister Christ,
  By daily walk making Him known;
  Imparting Christ by whom you live,
  Share with all men what you own.

To the lost world minister Christ,
Who is your life and your all,
Imparting Christ to all you meet,
All fallen ones, great or small.

  To the lost world minister Christ,
  By daily walk making Him known;
  Imparting Christ by whom you live,
  Share with all men what you own.--------923
Go to collect materials for the House,
Go to convince dear souls and bring them in;
Bring in the very souls whom God has made,
Bring in the souls usurped by every sin.

Go to collect materials for the House,
Go to deliver people from the world,
From all Satanic darkness and deceit,
From the allurements Satan has unfurled.

Go to collect materials for the House,
Go to win souls to glorify the Lord;
Go to defeat the enemy of God,
Go, sinners to release, with one accord.

Go to collect materials for the House,
Go, Christ proclaiming, on the Body ground;
Go thus in oneness with the faithful saints,
And let the trumpet of the gospel sound.--------924
Along the shores of Galilee,
When Christ five thousand fed,
Not one was omitted
In the breaking of the bread.
Today they die in heathen lands,
They die in want and dread,
For they have been omitted
In the breaking of the Bread.

  Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
  The Living Water too;
  My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
  Ready, Thy will to do."

Long years have passed and few have heard
That Jesus Christ has bled,
That they might feed on Him who died
To be that Living Bread.
To gods of stone and wood they cry,
Yet they are never fed,
For they have been omitted
In the breaking of the Bread.

  Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
  The Living Water too;
  My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
  Ready, Thy will to do."

Great God, who gave Thine only Son,
Help us, now Spirit-led,
To tell the story of Thy love
To those who ask for bread.
Then gladly will we go or send,
Till this blest news has spread,
And they have been included
In the breaking of the Bread.

  Lord, I would give them the Bread of Life,
  The Living Water too;
  My heart cries out, "Oh, here am I,
  Ready, Thy will to do."--------925
Outreach of the glorious gospel
Is the flow of life within;
It is by our testimony
That lost sinners we may win.

  Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
  May Thy life through us be seen;
  Through us as Thy living vessels
  Quicken people from within.

It is by the life convincing
That the people may believe;
It is by the life imparting
That the souls may life receive.

  Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
  May Thy life through us be seen;
  Through us as Thy living vessels
  Quicken people from within.

Always in the Lord abiding,
As the branches fruit to bear;
By the inner life out-flowing
Christ with others we may share.

  Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
  May Thy life through us be seen;
  Through us as Thy living vessels
  Quicken people from within.

May our living be the preaching,
Making Christ to others known;
Not the word of doctrine-preaching,
But the seed of life be sown.

  Grant us, Lord, the living outflow,
  May Thy life through us be seen;
  Through us as Thy living vessels
  Quicken people from within.--------926
Send Thou, O Lord, to every place
Swift messengers before Thy face,
The heralds of Thy wondrous grace,
Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

Send men whose eyes have seen the King!
Men in whose eyes His sweet words ring;
Send such Thy lost ones home to bring;
Send them where Thou wilt come.

To bring good news to souls in sin;
The bruised and broken hearts to win;
In every place to bring them in,
Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

Gird each one with the Spirit's sword,
The sword of Thine own deathless word;
And make them conquerors, conquering Lord,
Where Thou Thyself wilt come.

Raise up, O Lord the Holy Ghost,
From this broad land a mighty host,
Their war-cry, We will seek the lost,
Where Thou, O Christ, wilt come!--------927
O God of burning altar fire,
O God of love's consuming flame,
Make pure the flame of our desire
To win the lost to seek Thy Name.

There is no coldness, Lord, in Thee,
Oh, keep us kindled lest we bring
To our dear Lord of Calvary,
Dead ashes for our offering.

Dead ashes, husk of corn for wheat
Lord of our consecration vow,
We gather round Thy wounded feet,
We see the thorn about Thy brow.

Oh, by Thy cross and passion, Lord,
Grant us this plea, this sovereign plea,
Save us from choosing peace for sword,
And give us souls to give to Thee.--------928
Is your life a channel of blessing?
Is the love of God flowing through you?
Are you telling the lost of the Savior?
Are you ready His service to do?

  Make me a channel of blessing today,
  Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
  My life possessing, my service blessing,
  Make me a channel of blessing today.

Is your life a channel of blessing?
Are you burdened for those that are lost?
Have you urged upon those who are straying,
The Savior who died on the cross?

  Make me a channel of blessing today,
  Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
  My life possessing, my service blessing,
  Make me a channel of blessing today.

We cannot be channels of blessing
If our lives are not free from all sin;
We will barriers be and a hindrance
To those we are trying to win.

  Make me a channel of blessing today,
  Make me a channel of blessing, I pray;
  My life possessing, my service blessing,
  Make me a channel of blessing today.--------929
Out in the highways and byways of life,
Many are weary and sad;
Carry the sunshine where darkness is rife,
Making the sorrowing glad.

  Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
  Out of my life may Jesus shine;
  Make me a blessing, O Savior, I pray,
  Make me a blessing to someone today.

Tell the sweet story of Christ and His love,
Tell of His pow'r to forgive;
Others will trust Him if only you prove
True, every moment you live.

  Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
  Out of my life may Jesus shine;
  Make me a blessing, O Savior, I pray,
  Make me a blessing to someone today.

Give as 'twas given to you in your need,
Love as the Master loved you;
Be to the helpless a helper indeed,
Unto your mission be true.

  Make me a blessing, make me a blessing,
  Out of my life may Jesus shine;
  Make me a blessing, O Savior, I pray,
  Make me a blessing to someone today.--------930
"Must I go, and empty-handed,"
Thus my dear Redeemer meet?
Not one day of service give Him,
Lay no trophy at His feet?

  "Must I go, and empty-handed?"
  Must I meet my Savior so?
  Not one soul with which to greet Him:
  Must I empty-handed go?

Not at death I shrink nor falter,
For my Savior saves me now;
But to meet Him empty-handed,
Thought of that now clouds my brow.

  "Must I go, and empty-handed?"
  Must I meet my Savior so?
  Not one soul with which to greet Him:
  Must I empty-handed go?

O the years in sinning wasted;
Could I but recall them now,
I would give them to my Savior,
To His will I'd gladly bow.

  "Must I go, and empty-handed?"
  Must I meet my Savior so?
  Not one soul with which to greet Him:
  Must I empty-handed go?

O ye saints, arouse, be earnest,
Up and work while yet 'tis day;
Ere the night of death o'ertake thee,
Strive for souls while still you may.

  "Must I go, and empty-handed?"
  Must I meet my Savior so?
  Not one soul with which to greet Him:
  Must I empty-handed go?--------931
Out in the darkness,
Shadowed by sin,
Souls are in bondage,
Souls we would win.
How can we win them?
How show the way?
"Love never faileth,"
Love is the way.

Think how the Savior
Came from above
Suffered on Calvary,
Breathed out love;
Think how He loves us,
E'en when we stray:
We must love others,
Love is His way.

See, they are waiting,
Looking at you,
Silently watching
All that you do;
Seeming so careless,
Hardened and lost:
"Love never faileth,"
Count not the cost.

"Love never faileth,"
Love is pure gold:
Love is what Jesus
Came to unfold;
Love these souls thru us,
Savior, we pray;
Thy love ne'er faileth,
Love is Thy way.--------932
Lord, lay some soul upon my heart,
And love that soul through me;
And may I bravely do my part
To win that soul for Thee.

  Some soul for Thee, some soul for Thee,
  This is my earnest plea;
  Help me each day, on life's highway,
  To win some soul for Thee.

Lord, lead me to some soul in sin,
And grant that I may be
Endued with power and love to win
That soul, dear Lord, for Thee.

  Some soul for Thee, some soul for Thee,
  This is my earnest plea;
  Help me each day, on life's highway,
  To win some soul for Thee.

To win that soul for Thee, my Lord,
Will be my constant prayer;
That when I've won Thy full reward
I'll with that dear one share.

  Some soul for Thee, some soul for Thee,
  This is my earnest plea;
  Help me each day, on life's highway,
  To win some soul for Thee.--------933
I have a Savior, He's pleading in glory,
A dear loving Savior, though earth-friends be few;
And now He is watching in tenderness o'er me,
But oh, that my Savior were your Savior too!

  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  I'm praying for you.

I have a Father: to me He has given
A hope for eternity, blessed and true;
He'll call me one day to the kingdom of heaven,
But oh, that He'd let me bring you with me too!

  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  I'm praying for you.

I have a peace: it is calm as a river,
A peace that the friends of this world never knew;
My Savior alone is its Author and Giver,
And oh, could I know it was given to you!

  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  For you I am praying,
  I'm praying for you.--------934
I cannot tell why He, whom angels worship,
Should set His love upon the sons of men,
Or why, as Shepherd, He should seek the wand'rers,
To bring them back, they know not how or when.
But this I know, that He was born of Mary,
When Bethl'hem's manger was His only home,
And that He lived at Nazareth and labored,
And so the Savior, Savior of the world, is come.

I cannot tell how silently He suffered,
As with His peace He graced this place of tears,
Or how His heart upon the Cross was broken,
The crown of pain to three and thirty years.
But this I know, He heals the broken-hearted,
And stays our sin, and calms our lurking fear,
And lifts the burden from the heavy laden,
For yet the Savior, Savior of the world, is here.

I cannot tell how He will win the nations,
How He will claim His earthly heritage,
How satisfy the needs and aspirations
Of east and west, of sinner and of sage.
But this I know, all flesh shall see His glory,
And He shall reap the harvest He has sown,
And some glad day His sun shall shine in splendor
When He the Savior, Savior of the world, is known.

I cannot tell how all the lands shall worship,
When, at His bidding, every storm is stilled,
Or who can say how great the jubilation
When all the hearts of men with love are filled.
But this I know, the skies will thrill with rapture,
And myriad, myriad human voices sing,
And earth to heaven, and heaven to earth, will answer:
At last the Savior, Savior of the world, is King.--------935
Around Thy grave, Lord Jesus,
In spirit here we stand,
With hearts all full of praises,
To keep Thy blest command:
Our souls by faith rejoicing,
To trace Thy path of love,
Down through death's angry billows,
Up to the throne above.

Lord Jesus! we remember
The travail of Thy soul,
When through Thy love's deep pity,
The waves did o'er Thee roll;
Baptized in death's dark waters,
For us Thy blood was shed;
For us Thou, Lord of Glory,
Wast numbered with the dead.

O Lord! Thou now art risen,
Thy travail all is o'er;
For sin Thou once hast suffered,
Thou liv'st to die no more;
Sin, death and hell are vanquished
By Thee, the Church's Head;
And lo! we share Thy triumphs,
Thou first-born from the dead.

Unto Thy death baptizd,
We own with Thee we died;
With Thee, our Life, we're risen,
And shall be glorified.
From sin, the world, and Satan,
We're ransomed by Thy blood,
And here would walk as strangers,
Alive with Thee to God.--------936
In death's waters I am buried,
For with Christ my Savior, I have died;
Now the world cannot pursue me,
For its power here is nullified.
I with Christ have risen too,
Out of death with Him I walk and live;
Now the Spirit life supplies
And His strength exhaustless unto me doth give.--------937
Lord, when by baptism we confess
Our oneness in Thy death,
Oh, by Thy mercy and Thy grace,
May Thou reveal its worth.

By baptism in Thy death we're one
And buried too with Thee;
Thus we're forever dead to sin
And from its bondage free.

By baptism in Thy death we're one
And buried too with Thee;
Thus to the world we bid farewell,
From Satan's slavery free.

We're resurrected with Thee too,
From death's great pow'r set free;
Now fruit of holiness we bear
In our new life with Thee.

We're baptized unto Thy dear name,
No more our own are we;
Thy steps we'd follow, for Thee live,
And e'er be one with Thee.--------938
Already dead! And buried too!
With the old man I am through!
Already dead! And buried too!
With the old man I am through!

No longer I! No longer I!
Christ in me I'll testify!
No longer I! No longer I!
Christ in me I'll testify!--------939
O day of resurrection,
O day of joy and light,
O seal of our redemption,
Most beautiful, most bright:
On thee the high and lowly,
Bending before the throne,
Sing "Holy, holy, holy,"
To the great Three in One.

On thee at the creation
The light first had its birth;
On thee, for our salvation,
Christ rose from depths of earth;
On thee, our Lord, victorious,
The Spirit sent from heaven;
And thus on thee, most glorious,
A triple light was given.

Today on weary nations
The heavenly manna falls!
To holy convocations
The silver trumpet calls,
Where gospel light is glowing
With pure and radiant beams,
And living water flowing
With soul-refreshing streams.

New graces ever gaining
From this of days the best,
We reach the rest remaining
For people who are blest;
To Holy Ghost be praises,
To Father and to Son;
The Church her voice upraises
To Thee, blest Three in One.--------940
  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Passing through another week,
God has granted us His aid;
Let us now a blessing seek,
On the day the Lord hath made;
Day of all the week the best,
Emblem of eternal rest.

While we pray for pard'ning grace,
Through the dear Redeemer's name,
Show Thy reconcild face;
Take away our sin and shame:
From our worldly cares set free,
May we rest this day in Thee.

Here we come Thy name to praise,
Let us feel Thy presence near;
May Thy glory meet our eyes,
While we in Thy house appear:
Here afford us, Lord, a taste
Of our everlasting feast.

May Thy gospel's joyful sound
Conquer sinners, comfort saints;
Make the fruits of grace abound,
Bring relief for all complaints:
Thus may all our Lord's Days prove,
Till we meet the Lord above.--------941
God's kingdom is God's reigning,
His glory to maintain;
It is His sovereign ruling,
His order to sustain.
He exercises fully
His own authority
Within His kingdom ever
And to eternity.

Upon the throne, the center
Of government divine,
God reigns, and with His purpose
Brings everything in line.
God's headship and His lordship
He only can maintain
As King within His kingdom,
O'er everything to reign.

By reigning in His kingdom
God worketh all His will,
And under His dominion
His purpose doth fulfill.
'Tis only in God's kingdom
His blessing we may know;
'Tis from His throne almighty
The stream of life doth flow.

Submitted to God's ruling,
All virtue thus will win;
Rebellion to His Headship
Is but the root of sin.
The evil aim of Satan
God's throne to overthrow;
Our aim and goal is ever
His rule to fully know.

Within God's sovereign kingdom
His Christ is magnified;
When Christ in life is reigning,
The Father's glorified.
When God is in dominion,
All things are truly blessed;
When Christ for God is reigning,
God's glory is expressed.

In fulness of the seasons
God's Christ will head up all,
Then all will own His reigning
And worship, great and small.
Such reign in life and glory
The Church e'en now foretastes,
And to His rule submitting
Unto His kingdom hastes.--------942
God's Kingdom on the earth is now
His sovereign government within;
'Tis Christ Himself in us to live
As Lord and King to rule and reign.

His life with His authority
Enthrones Him now within our hearts
To govern all our words and deeds
And regulate our inward parts.

The Lord enthroned within our hearts
His Kingdom doth establish there,
Assuring His full right to reign
And for God's purpose to prepare.

'Tis by His reign within our hearts
That life to us He e'er supplies;
When taking Him as Lord and King,
His wealth our being satisfies.

'Tis by His ruling from within
His fulness vast is testified;
'Tis when His inner kingdom rules
His Body's blessed and edified.

'Tis by His heav'nly rule within
As heav'nly citizens we live;
'Tis by submission to His rule
Expression of His reign we give.

Here in this heav'nly realm we live,
And with this heav'nly pow'r possessed
We walk and fight in heav'nly light
Until the Kingdom's manifest.--------943
Requirements of the Kingdom are
Much stricter than the law's decrees;
No other requisite of God
Has ever higher been than these.

"Repent, the Kingdom has come near,"
This is the Kingdom's first demand;
A change of mind we all must have
And on God's side must firmly stand.

That we the Kingdom enter in,
Surpassing righteousness we need,
Exceeding that which is of law;
From life alone it must proceed.

That we the Kingdom enter in,
We need to do the Father's will,
Not by our choice to work or act
But His one purpose to fulfill.

That we the Kingdom enter in,
A simple child we must become
Adjustable, obedient, meek
And everything of self o'ercome.

The Heav'nly Kingdom e'en requires
That we as God should perfect be;
This standard we must fully meet
That we may share its ecstasy.

The Kingdom is the reign of God
To match His nature is required;
'Tis only by the life of God
The Kingdom's entry is acquired.

The Kingdom is the rule of heav'n;
With heaven's state we must accord;
'Tis only by the life of heav'n
That we may share it with the Lord.--------944
The essence of the Kingdom is
A life that's under heaven's rule,
A life whose nature is divine
With Christ experienced in full.

Such is this life: in spirit poor,
With heart repentant, mourning, meek,
Which is to others merciful
And purely God Himself doth seek;

As sons of God the peace to make,
For righteousness e'en suffering pain;
Reviled and hurt for Jesus' sake,
Exceeding joyfulness to gain;

As salt to kill corruption rife,
In darkness shining as the light,
In heart and action right and true,
In perfect love to claim no right.

This life self-glory doth renounce
And ever for God's kingdom prays;
It trusts in God for every need
And seeks His kingdom first always.

'Tis strict with self, with others kind,
And always dealing with the Lord;
It ever does the Father's will
And acts according to His word.

To Satan it does not give ground,
Nor to the world, or self, or sin,
But seeks beneath the heaven's rule
God's full authority to win.

'Tis such a life which subjugates
All things with pow'r to God's behest;
The time it hastens when the Lord
Will here His kingdom manifest.--------945
The Son of God has come to sow
Himself, the seed of life, in man,
That thru Himself God's Kingdom grow
And thus fulfill th' eternal plan.

He was the only grain of wheat
Whence many grains have been produced
To be the Kingdom's children meet,
Thru whom God's reign is introduced.

But Satan, enemy of God,
Sowed many tares among the wheat,
The Kingdom's children to confuse,
And awful damage to create.

'Tis by this subtle work of his,
The mixing of the tares with wheat,
The Kingdom in appearance is
Abnormal and grotesquely great.

The Kingdom should as mustard be,
A little herb, yet good for food,
But it has changed into a "tree,"
A system of great magnitude.

Instead of being good for food,
A lodge of "birds" it has become;
'Tis now a place where evil men
And evil spirits make their home.

A great religion of the world
Its outward form to us reveals,
Including pagan, evil things,
As leaven mingled with the meal.

A system of the world as such,
It thus has changed in outward form;
By evil things which it imbibes,
Corruption inwardly doth swarm.

But something hidden God doth seek,
As "pearl" and "treasure in the field";
As such the Lord would us transform
That pearl and treasure be revealed.

10 'Tis hidden from vast Christendom
And from the Kingdom's great facade,
Yet in its full reality
'Tis transformed like to Christ and God.

11 Lord, separate us from the "tares,"
And save us from the monstrous "tree";
From all the "leaven" purge us now
That we may purely be of Thee.

12 May Thou in life transform our souls
That we as precious stones may be,
Meet for Thy house to build and in
Thy Kingdom's full reality.--------946
Lo, the glory! Lo, the splendor!
Heaven's Kingdom manifest!
And its glorious King, our Master,
Is by God's appointment blest.
Once in flesh He came so lowly,
Hated and despised by man;
Now He comes again in glory
To fulfill the Kingdom plan.

Going to receive the Kingdom
From His God, the Ancient of Days,
Now He cometh with the Kingdom
And its glorious, ruling rays.
He's "the Stone" which breaks the nations
Into pieces lowliest,
Which "a mountain great" becometh
As the Kingdom manifest.

Lo, the earth, all lands and kingdoms,
By the Lord and Christ possessed;
Earth beneath their sovereign ruling
Will be full of peace and rest.
No more war and no more hatred
'Twixt the nations will there be;
But God's knowledge shall suffuse them
As the waters fill the sea.

All the Christian overcomers
Shall with Christ in glory reign,
And the remnant saved of Israel
Then God's priesthood shall obtain.
As God's people shall the nations
'Neath their rule and teaching be,
And a glorious restoration
All creation then shall see.

Satan will be bound and banished;
From his rule will earth be freed;
With Christ's sovereign reign and headship
Earth will then be blessed indeed.
All to Christ will then be subject,
To His pow'r and to His will;
As the Head and Center glorious,
He God's purpose will fulfill.--------947
God's Kingdom today is a real exercise,
But when Christ comes to reign it will be a great prize;
It is wisdom divine that we now may be trained
That His plan be fulfilled and His justice maintained.

God's children, we're born to be kings with His Son,
And we need to be trained that we may overcome
And to know how to rule in His kingdom as kings,
That His kingship thru us be expressed o'er all things.

Today we must learn to submit to His throne,
How to have a strict life and His government own;
His authority then we'll be able to share,
O'er the nations to rule with God's Son as the heir.

With a life strict to self we must righteousness hold,
Kind to others in peace, and with God joyful, bold;
In the Kingdom's reality e'er to remain,
For its manifestation prepared thus to reign.

Then Christ when He comes with the kingdom from God
Will to us grant His kingship to share as reward;
Thus the Lord will His righteousness thru us maintain
And His wisdom to heavenly powers make plain.

For this the Apostle pressed on at all cost,
For the Kingdom assured that he would not be lost;
'Tis for this he charged others, Be true to the Lord,
That the Kingdom might be unto them a reward.

O Lord, give us grace for Thy Kingdom to live,
To be trained that Thou may the reward to us give;
Make the Kingdom's reality our exercise,
That its manifestation may be our great prize.--------948
Myst'ry hid from ages now revealed to me,
'Tis the Christ of God's reality.
He embodies God, and He is life to me,
And the glory of my hope He'll be.

  Glory, glory, Christ is life in me!
  Glory, glory, what a hope is He!
  Now within my spirit He's the mystery!
  Then the glory He will be to me.

In my spirit He regenerated me,
In my soul He's now transforming me.
He will change my body like unto His own,
Wholly making me the same as He.

  Glory, glory, Christ is life in me!
  Glory, glory, what a hope is He!
  Now within my spirit He's the mystery!
  Then the glory He will be to me.

Now in life and nature He is one with me;
Then in Him, the glory, I will be;
I'll enjoy His presence for eternity
With Him in complete conformity.

  Glory, glory, Christ is life in me!
  Glory, glory, what a hope is He!
  Now within my spirit He's the mystery!
  Then the glory He will be to me.--------949
Christ is the hope of glory, my very life is He,
He has regenerated and saturated me;
He comes to change my body by His subduing might
Like to His glorious body in glory bright!

  He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!
  My body He'll transfigure, like His own it then will be.
  He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!
  As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.

Christ is the hope of glory, He is God's mystery;
He shares with me God's fulness and brings God into me.
He comes to make me blended with God in every way,
That I may share His glory with Him for aye.

  He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!
  My body He'll transfigure, like His own it then will be.
  He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!
  As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.

Christ is the hope of glory, redemption full is He:
Redemption to my body, from death to set it free,
He comes to make my body a glorious one to be
And swallow death forever in victory.

  He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!
  My body He'll transfigure, like His own it then will be.
  He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!
  As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.

Christ is the hope of glory, He is my history:
His life is my experience, for He is one with me;
He comes to bring me into His glorious liberty,
That one with Him completely I'll ever be.

  He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!
  My body He'll transfigure, like His own it then will be.
  He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!
  As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.--------950
And it is so! I shall be like Thy Son?
Is this the grace which He for me has won?
Father of glory  thought beyond all thought!
In glory, to His own blest likeness brought!

Oh, Jesus, Lord, who loved me like to Thee?
Fruit of Thy work, with Thee, too, there to see
Thy glory, Lord, while endless ages roll,
Myself the prize and travail of Thy soul.

Yet it must be: Thy love had not its rest
Were Thy redeemed not with Thee fully blest;
That love that gives not as the world, but shares
All it possesses with its loved co-heirs.

Nor I alone; Thy loved ones, all complete
In glory, round Thee there with joy shall meet;
All like Thee, for Thy glory like Thee, Lord,
Object supreme of all, by all adored.--------951
Christ is coming! Let creation
From her groans and travail cease,
Let the glorious proclamation
Hope restore, and faith increase.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Thou blessed Prince of Peace.

Earth can now but tell the story
Of Thy bitter cross and pain;
She shall yet behold Thy glory
When Thou comest back to reign.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Let each heart repeat the strain.

Long Thy people have been pining
For Thy peace and rest, and Thee,
Soon, in heav'nly glory shining,
Their Restorer shall they see,
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Haste the joyous jubilee.

With that blessed hope before us,
Let no harp remain unstrung;
Let the mighty advent chorus
Onward roll on every tongue.
Christ is coming! Christ is coming!
Come, Lord Jesus, quickly come.--------952
A lamp in the night, a song in time of sorrow,
A great glad hope which faith can ever borrow
To gild the passing day with the glory of the morrow,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

  Blessed hope, blessed hope,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
  How the aching heart it cheers;
  How it glistens through our tears,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.

A star in the sky, a beacon bright to guide us;
An anchor sure to hold when storms betide us;
A refuge for the soul, where in quiet we may hide us,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

  Blessed hope, blessed hope,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
  How the aching heart it cheers;
  How it glistens through our tears,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.

A call of command, like trumpet clearly sounding,
To make us bold when evil is surrounding;
To stir the sluggish heart, and to keep in good abounding,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

  Blessed hope, blessed hope,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
  How the aching heart it cheers;
  How it glistens through our tears,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.

A word from the One to all our hearts the dearest,
A parting word to make Him aye the nearest;
Of all His precious words, the sweetest, brightest, clearest,
Is the hope of the coming of the Lord.

  Blessed hope, blessed hope,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord;
  How the aching heart it cheers;
  How it glistens through our tears,
  Blessed hope of the coming of the Lord.--------953
Our Lord is now rejected,
And by the world disowned,
By the many still neglected,
And by the few enthroned;
But soon He'll come in glory!
The hour is drawing nigh,
For the crowning day is coming
By-and-by.

  O the crowning day is coming,
  Is coming by-and-by,
  When our Lord shall come in power
  And glory from on high.
  O the glorious sight will gladden
  Each waiting, watchful eye,
  In the crowning day that's coming
  By-and-by.

The heavens shall glow with splendor,
But brighter far than they,
The saints shall shine in glory,
As Christ shall them array.
The beauty of the Savior
Shall dazzle every eye,
In the crowning day that's coming
By-and-by.

  O the crowning day is coming,
  Is coming by-and-by,
  When our Lord shall come in power
  And glory from on high.
  O the glorious sight will gladden
  Each waiting, watchful eye,
  In the crowning day that's coming
  By-and-by.

Our pain shall then be over,
We'll sin and sigh no more,
Behind us all of sorrow,
And naught but joy before,
A joy in our Redeemer,
As we to Him are nigh,
In the crowning day that's coming
By-and-by.

  O the crowning day is coming,
  Is coming by-and-by,
  When our Lord shall come in power
  And glory from on high.
  O the glorious sight will gladden
  Each waiting, watchful eye,
  In the crowning day that's coming
  By-and-by.

Let all that look for hasten
The coming joyful day,
By earnest consecration,
To walk the narrow way;
By gathering in the lost ones,
For whom our Lord did die,
For the crowning day that's coming
By-and-by.

  O the crowning day is coming,
  Is coming by-and-by,
  When our Lord shall come in power
  And glory from on high.
  O the glorious sight will gladden
  Each waiting, watchful eye,
  In the crowning day that's coming
  By-and-by.--------954
There's a light upon the mountains,
and the day is at the spring,
When our eyes shall see the beauty
and the glory of the King;
Weary was our heart with waiting,
and the night-watch seemed so long,
But His triumph-day is breaking, and
we hail it with a song.

In the fading of the starlight we can
see the coming morn;
And the lights of men are paling in
the splendors of the dawn;
For the eastern skies are glowing as
with lights of hidden fire,
And the hearts of men are stirring
with the throb of deep desire.

There's a hush of expectation, and
a quiet in the air;
And the breath of God is moving in
the fervent breath of prayer;
For the suffering,
dying Jesus is the Christ upon the throne,
And the travail of our spirit is the
travail of His own.

He is breaking down the barriers,
He is casting up the way;
He is calling for His angels to build
up the gates of day;
But His angels here are human, not
the shining hosts above,
For the drum-beats of His army are
the heart-beats of our love.

Hark! we hear a distant music, and
it comes with fuller swell;
'Tis the triumph song of Jesus, of
our King Emmanuel;
Zion, go ye forth to meet Him,
and my soul, be swift to bring
All thy sweetest and thy dearest for
the triumph of our King.--------955
In the advent light, O Savior,
I am living day by day;
Waiting, working, watching ever,
Knowing Thou art on Thy way.

Separated unto Jesus,
Loosed from all the world beside;
Blinded by the advent glory,
Hour by hour would I abide.

So from glory unto glory,
Gladdened by the advent ray;
All the path is growing brighter,
Shining unto perfect day.

In the advent light to witness
To a dark and dying world;
This the holy ordination;
May His banner be unfurled.

In the advent light rejoicing;
Songs of praise along the road
Seem to make the journey shorter,
Mounting upward to our God.

He is coming! He is coming!
Pass the heavenly watchword on:
Go ye forth to meet the Bridegroom,
Hail! to God's anointed Son.

See the advent glory breaking;
Faith will soon be lost in sight;
Face to face I shall behold Him,
Bathed in His eternal light.--------956
Soon our Lord will come, the day is drawing nigh,
Sound of His approaching we can hear.
Watchful we must be and always on alert
That the Lord our hearts with rapture cheer.

  Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
  Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
  With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
  Singing all His praise with glad accord.

Soon our Lord will come, the Morning Star appear;
Night is deep, and soon will dawn the day.
Never with the current of the age we go,
That from trials we'll be kept away.

  Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
  Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
  With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
  Singing all His praise with glad accord.

Soon our Lord will come His servants to reward;
Those who love Him then the crown will share.
Watchful we must be and treasure not the world,
Love and serve the Lord, His burden bear.

  Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
  Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
  With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
  Singing all His praise with glad accord.

Soon our Lord will come and in His kingdom reign;
Satan will be bound, the world subdued.
We must fight the battle, overcome the foe,
On His throne He then will us include.

  Glory! Glory! Christ will come again!
  Glory! Glory! We with Him shall reign!
  With a glorious body, ever with the Lord,
  Singing all His praise with glad accord.--------957
Watch! for the morning is breaking,
A moment, and He will be here!
The mists and the shadows are fleeing,
The darkness will soon disappear;
And He, for whom ages have waited,
The Lord Who has tarried so long,
Will come in an outburst of glory,
A moment, and we shall be gone.

Watch! for the morning is breaking,
A moment, the crown will be won!
A moment, and we shall be with Him,
A moment, the journey is done!
Lord, keep us each moment unsleeping,
And count us all worthy to be
In that noble band of Thy watchers,
Whose life is a vigil with Thee.--------958
Since long ago at Bethany we parted,
Within my heart there is a ceaseless void;
How can I take my harp down from the willow?
How can my songs without Thee be enjoyed?
And when at night I'm keeping lonely vigil
Grown numb alike to sorrow and to cheer
Then I recall the promise of Thy coming,
But sigh: O Lord, why, why Thou dost not yet appear?

Thy manger wakes the thought: I too am homeless;
Thy cross strips earthly pleasures from my soul;
Thy coming bids me seek a better country,
For Thou Thyself art now my final goal.
Since Thou art gone my joy has lost its flavor,
My song the sweetness I would fain convey.
Since Thou art gone the sense of void o'erwhelms me.
Oh, how I long that Thou wilt come and not delay.

Though even now I know Thy loving presence,
Yet in my heart there's still a sense of lack.
Enlightening and tenderest sustaining
Can no more satisfy: I want Thee back.
Despite Thy peace within, I still feel lonely;
Despite Thy joy there still remains a sigh;
When I feel most content, the silent yearning
To see Thee face to face becomes an uttered cry.

What exile cannot but desire his homeland
And long his people once again to greet?
What soul on alien soil forgets his kindred?
What parted lovers never yearn to meet?
O Lord, how can these earthly loves and pleasures
With all the joy of Thy return compare?
Then, if I cannot here behold Thy countenance,
What can I do but sigh till Thou, my Lord, appear?

Could'st Thou, O Lord, forget Thy word of promise
Soon to return and take me unto Thee?
Yet day by day and year by year I've waited
And still I wait, and no return I see!
Remember, Lord, the years I have been waiting
While Thy dear footsteps linger far away.
How long? How long? Oh! must I wait still longer
Till Thou shalt come again in glorious array?

From generation unto generation
Thy saints have come and gone, but have not seen
Thy glorious promise pass into fulfilment.
How long, how very long the time has been!
Why cannot we, dear Lord, discern Thy footsteps?
Why are the heavens still so closely sealed?
Oh! must our waiting be prolonged still further
Before Thou in Thy matchless splendor art revealed?

Lord, I recall the many years I've waited
For Thy return  yet, Lord, not I alone,
But Thy dear saints through many generations
Beseeching Thee to come back for Thine own.
To countless tears and countless fervent pleadings,
By Thine appearing haste to make reply.
Oh, may Thou come, the echo of the ages,
Come, come and answer now this mighty corp'rate cry!--------959
Since Thy departure from Olivet's Mountain,
Why is Thy coming again so delayed?
Thru the long years we have longed for Thy coming;
Hast Thou not heard all the prayers that we've prayed?

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

Beloved Lord, since the year Thou ascended
Everything here has been tasteless and dry;
Often in praying and often in watching,
In every movement, for Thee, Lord, we sigh.

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

Scenes although lovely, yet when will we meet Thee?
Birds and the flowers fair beauty embrace;
All are delightsome, but none satisfy me,
For I am longing for Thy loving face.

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

Lord, we're impatient awaiting Thy coming,
We do not know how much longer 'twill be;
From every sunrise to every bright sunset
Hope we each moment Thy coming to see.

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

Whene'er 'tis raining, or strong winds are blowing,
Whene'er the moon shines, or rises the sea,
We ever hope to discover Thy coming;
How disappointed when no sign of Thee!

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

If it were not for the bidding Thou gav'st us,
We'd be discouraged, Thy service we'd shirk;
But Thou dost want us while waiting Thy coming,
For Thee to live and in diligence work.

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.

Oh Lord, remember the days have been lengthened
Since Thou hast promised ere going away;
We hope and hope and are endlessly hoping,
That Thou wilt come. Canst Thou come e'en today?

  Come Thou, come now:
  Lord, for Thy coming we yearn;
  All our desire is Thy promised returning,
  Oh, may Thou quickly return.--------960
My King will soon come back again,
The sky be filled with Him;
The universe to be redeemed
Will see His light therein.
The Lord will soon fulfill His plan,
His footsteps now I hear;
His glorious frame I faintly see
Beginning to appear.

I'm longing for His presence blest
And dare not slothful be
While waiting for my Lord's return,
His own dear self to see.
My only hope  that He may come
And change my faith to sight;
There is no other joy on earth
Which gives my heart delight.

My heart is always with Himself,
My eyes are heavenward,
My lips would utter nothing else
Than meeting with my Lord.
The coming of the Lord draws nigh,
His coming is for me;
His promise ever standeth firm
And soon fulfilled I'll see.

My Savior, all Thy holy words
Can never doubted be;
With them encouraged day by day,
I'm faithful unto Thee.
Oh, may Thy glory soon appear,
The foe be overthrown;
Thy promises be realized,
And we brought to Thy throne.

Thy saving arm a refuge is,
My Savior God, to me;
Thou as the father keepeth them
Who put their trust in Thee.
The sheep and shepherd are of one,
The head and body same;
None e'er can pluck from out Thy hand
The child who trusts Thy Name.

A thousand hands won't hinder me,
Nor will ten thousand eyes;
The thorns upon the road but help
Me onward to the prize.
Arise, my spirit and my heart,
And let the world go by;
The Lord of life will take me soon
To be with Him on high.

Thou healing sun! Thou hope of man!
I really love Thy ray.
Oh, righteous Lord! oh, glorious King!
I bow to Thee and pray:
Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne
And quickly show Thy face;
Thy heav'nly kingdom may Thou found
And grant all men Thy grace.

The truth should triumph and be king,
And freedom should be queen;
But falsehood, which has rampant run,
Head of the world is seen.
We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come
And bring Thy light from heav'n;
The foe be crushed and all Thy sons
Into Thy bosom giv'n.--------961
The Church has waited long,
Her absent Lord to see,
And still in loneliness she waits,
A friendless stranger she.
Age after age had gone,
Sun after sun has set,
And still in weeds of widowhood,
She weeps a mourner yet.

Saint after saint on earth
Has lived, and loved, and died;
And as they left us one by one,
We laid them side by side;
We laid them down to sleep,
But not in hope forlorn;
We laid them but to ripen there,
Till the last glorious morn.

The serpent's brood increase,
The powers of hell grow bold,
The conflict thickens, faith is low,
And love is waxing cold.
How long, O Lord our God,
Holy, and true, and good,
Wilt Thou not judge Thy suffering Church,
Her sighs, and tears, and blood?

We long to hear Thy voice,
To see Thee face to face,
To share Thy crown and glory then,
As now we share Thy grace.
Should not the loving bride
Her absent bridegroom mourn?
Should she not wear the signs of grief
Until her Lord return?

The whole creation groans,
And waits to hear that voice
That shall her beauteousness restore,
And make her wastes rejoice.
Come, Lord, and wipe away
The curse, the sin, the stain,
And make this blighted world of ours
Thine own fair world again.--------962
Oh, how long before my Lord comes back,
My heart desires to see Thy face,
That the song of triumph I may sing
And behold my Beloved, full of grace.
Come quickly, Lord, and tarry not!
Oh, when wilt Thou return to comfort me;
Come quickly, Lord and tarry not!
My heart desires to be with Thee.--------963
Face to face with Christ, my Savior,
Face to face  what will it be?
When with rapture I behold Him,
Jesus Christ who died for me.

  Face to face I shall behold Him,
  Far beyond the starry sky;
  Face to face in all His glory,
  I shall see Him by and by!

Only faintly now, I see Him,
With the darkling veil between,
But a blessed day is coming,
When His glory shall be seen.

  Face to face I shall behold Him,
  Far beyond the starry sky;
  Face to face in all His glory,
  I shall see Him by and by!

What rejoicing in His presence,
When are banished grief and pain;
When the crooked ways are straightened,
And the dark things shall be plain.

  Face to face I shall behold Him,
  Far beyond the starry sky;
  Face to face in all His glory,
  I shall see Him by and by!

Face to face! O blissful moment!
Face to face  to see and know;
Face to face with my Redeemer,
Jesus Christ who loves me so.

  Face to face I shall behold Him,
  Far beyond the starry sky;
  Face to face in all His glory,
  I shall see Him by and by!--------964
'Midst the darkness, storm, and sorrow,
One bright gleam I see;
Well I know the blessed morrow
Christ will come for me.
'Midst the peace, the joy, the glory
And the light, God's own,
Christ for me is watching, waiting,
Waiting 'til I come.

Long the blessed Guide has led me,
By the desert road;
Now I see the coming splendor,
Splendor of my God.
There amidst the love and glory
He is waiting yet;
On His hands a name is graven
He can ne'er forget.

Who is this, who comes to meet me,
On the desert way,
As the Morning Star foretelling
God's unclouded day?
He it is who came to win me,
On the cross of shame;
In His glory well I know Him,
Evermore the same.

O the blessed joy of meeting,
All the desert past;
O the wondrous words of greeting,
He shall speak at last!
He and I together ent'ring
The fair realm above;
He and I together sharing
All the Father's love.

Where no shade nor stain can enter,
Nor the gold be dim,
In His holiness unsullied,
I shall walk with Him.
Meet companion then for Jesus,
From Him, for Him, made
Glory of God's grace forever
There in me displayed.

He who in His hour of sorrow
Bore the curse alone;
I who through the lonely desert
Trod where He had gone;
He and I, in that bright glory,
One deep joy shall share
Mine, to be forever with Him;
His, that I am there.--------965
When my blest Lord will come again,
I will be saved from all my pain,
With all the saints I'll follow Him,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
With all the saints I'll follow Him,
O praise the Lord!

When I shall see Him face to face,
And dwell with Him thru endless days,
I will rejoice and sing His grace,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
I will rejoice and sing His grace,
O praise the Lord!

When I meet Him before the Throne,
My suff'rings then will all be gone,
The joy of vict'ry will be won,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
The joy of vict'ry will be won,
O praise the Lord!

In that day I will testify
That nothing with Christ's life can vie,
What glorious rapture to the sky,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
What glorious rapture to the sky,
O praise the Lord!

May we in our Lord's side e'er hide,
Be always one and ne'er divide,
That His heart may be satisfied,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
That His heart may be satisfied,
O praise the Lord!

O come, our King, O come, dear Lord!
Receive us by Thy promised word,
And give the victors Thy reward,
O praise the Lord!
O praise the Lord! O praise the Lord!
And give the victors Thy reward,
O praise the Lord!--------966
O hope of glory, our Christ will return!
We will be raptured, with glory transformed;
Glorified with Him, Himself to enjoy,
In His full likeness we then will be formed.

  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  We will be raptured, with glory transformed;
  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

O hope of glory, our Christ will return!
The old creation will vanish away,
No more we'll groan, but have full liberty,
Enjoy salvation in its utmost way.

  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  We will be raptured, with glory transformed;
  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

O hope of glory, our Christ will return!
Over the nations with Him we will reign,
Priests we will be in His presence to serve,
Thus His salvation in fulness we'll gain.

  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  We will be raptured, with glory transformed;
  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!

O hope of glory, our Christ will return!
Waiting and watching, we faithfully serve,
Running the race, pressing on toward the goal
That we the Kingdom's reward might deserve.

  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  Glorious hope! Christ will return!
  We will be raptured, with glory transformed;
  O hope of glory, our Christ will return!--------967
Thou art coming, O my Savior,
Thou art coming, O my King,
In Thy beauty all resplendent,
In Thy glory all transcendent;
Well may we rejoice and sing;
Coming! In the opening east,
Herald brightness slowly swells:
Coming! O my glorious Priest,
Hear we not Thy golden bells?

Thou art coming, Thou art coming;
We shall meet Thee on Thy way;
We shall see Thee, we shall know Thee,
We shall bless Thee, we shall show Thee
All our hearts could never say:
What an anthem that will be,
Ringing out our love to Thee,
Pouring out our rapture sweet
At Thine own all-glorious feet.

Thou art coming, at Thy table
We are witnesses for this;
While rememb'ring hearts Thou meetest
In communion clearest, sweetest,
Earnest of our coming bliss,
Showing not Thy death alone,
And Thy love exceeding great,
But Thy coming and Thy throne,
All for which we long and wait.

Oh, the joy to see Thee reigning,
Thee, my own beloved Lord!
Every tongue Thy Name confessing,
Worship, honor, glory, blessing,
Brought to Thee with one accord;
Thee, my Master and my Friend,
Vindicated and enthroned,
Unto earth's remotest end
Glorified, adored, and owned!--------968
Hail to the Lord's Anointed,
Great David's greater Son!
Hail, in the time appointed,
His reign on earth begun!
He comes to break oppression,
To set the captive free;
To take away transgression,
And rule in equity.

He shall come down like showers
Upon the fruitful earth;
And love, joy, hope, like flowers,
Spring in His path to birth:
Before Him on the mountains
Shall peace, the herald, go;
And righteousness, in fountains,
From hill to valley flow.

Kings shall fall down before Him,
And gold and incense bring;
All nations shall adore Him,
His praise all people sing;
For He shall have dominion
O'er river, sea, and shore,
Far as the eagle's pinion,
Or dove's light wing can soar.

To Him shall prayer unceasing
And daily vows ascend;
His kingdom still increasing,
A kingdom without end.
The mountain dews shall nourish
A seed in weakness sown,
Whose fruit shall spread and flourish,
And shake like Lebanon.

O'er every foe victorious
He on His throne shall rest,
From age to age more glorious,
All-blessing and all-blest.
The tide of time shall never
His covenant remove;
His Name shall stand forever,
His changeless Name of Love.--------969
Hark what a sound, and too divine for hearing,
Stirs on the earth and trembles in the air;
Is it the thunder of the Lord's appearing?
Is it the music of His people's prayer?

Surely He cometh, and a thousand voices
Shout to the saints, and to the deaf and dumb;
Surely He cometh, and the earth rejoices,
Glad in His coming who hath sworn: I come!

This hath He done, and shall we not adore Him?
This shall He do, and can we still despair?
Come, let us quickly fling ourselves before Him,
Cast at His feet the burden of our care.

Thru life and death, thru sorrow and thru sinning
He shall suffice me, for He hath sufficed:
Christ is the end, for Christ was the beginning,
Christ the beginning, for the end is Christ.--------970
For the glorious revelation
Of the sons of God to come,
All the creatures wait, expecting,
That they all may free become.

All creation groans together,
Subject now to vanity,
Looking for their full deliv'rance
From corruption's slavery.

Even we ourselves are groaning,
Till we reach maturity;
We are growing to adoption,
With Christ in conformity.

'Tis for this the Spirit groaneth,
That to Christ we be conformed;
All things also work together,
That in life we be transformed.

God will bring us into glory,
We will then be glorified;
Fully saturated with Him,
We'll be wholly sanctified.

To the freedom of this glory,
All creation will be freed;
With the kid shall lie the leopard,
And the cow with bear shall feed.

Heirs with Christ in full adoption,
We'll His heritage possess,
Glorified with Him as brethren,
God's full glory we'll express.--------971
God's eternal purpose
Is to join with man,
Causing man, His vessel,
To be born again,
His own life imparting,
Filling to the brim;
Man may thus express Him,
And be one with Him.

God in His own image
Hath created man,
That he may be able
To fulfill His plan;
That he may receive Him
As the tree of life
To become His fulness
As to man the wife.

In His life's rich flowing
Man will be transformed
Into precious substance
And to Him conformed.
Thus will man be builded
As His counterpart,
Thus to be His dwelling,
Satisfy His heart.

'Tis the holy city,
New Jerusalem;
With His saints God mingles,
Makes His home with them.
He becomes their content,
His expression they;
They shall share His glory,
One with Him for aye.

He's the very center,
Ruling on the throne;
By His life the power,
Saints are kept in one.
By His light of glory,
They are kept in light,
Harmony enjoying
In divine delight.

He's their living water,
And their food supply;
All their thirst and hunger
He doth satisfy.
He's for them the temple,
In Himself they live,
In His constant presence
Worship ever give.--------972
Lo, the central thought of God
Is that He be one with man;
He to man is everything
That He might fulfill His plan.

Earthen vessel man was made
Body, soul, and spirit too,
God as life that he may take
And with Him have oneness true.

By the flow of life divine,
Man becomes a precious stone
Fit for building God's abode,
That His glory might be known.

'Tis the city God hath built,
'Tis the dwelling God requires,
'Tis the new Jerusalem
Which fulfills His heart's desires.

'Tis the building of the saints,
'Tis the blend of God and man,
Purposed by the Father's will
Long before the world began.

In its center, as its pow'r,
Is the throne of Christ and God,
Whence doth flow the stream of life
As the Spirit's living flood.

Christ, the tree of life, is there
In the flowing of the stream,
Yielding fruit of life divine
As the food of life supreme.

God in Christ, the glorious light,
Thru the city brightly shines,
Scattering all the deathly night
With its light of life divine.

God in man and man in God
Mutual dwelling thus possess;
God the content is to man,
And the man doth God express.--------973
Our goal  the holy city with the Lord,
It is our portion, 'tis where He's adored;
Although our bodies still are living here,
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there;
Our spirits with our glorious Lord are there.

Our goal divine  the new Jerusalem
That holy city made for God with men;
For all redeemed, who have Thy pathway trod,
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God,
Shall have the right to share the bliss with God.

And every time we toward that city gaze,
Then every time we long to see Thy face;
We long to hear the shout that calls to Thee,
With Thee to share Thy God eternally,
With Thee to share Thy God eternally.

Our heart's desire is not the peace so sweet,
Our longed for hope is not the joy we'll meet;
But Thou Thyself, Thou art "our hope," O Lord,
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward,
For 'tis Thyself that will be our reward.

O Jesus, Lord, we pray Thee hear our cry,
Come! Bring us to that city from on high!
That in that glory we may share with Thee,
Thy loving Self partake eternally,
Thy loving Self partake eternally.

O Lord, Thou sayest, "I make all things new,"
New heav'ns, new earth, and all within them too!
Our God Himself our portion then shall be;
O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee,
O Lord, come quickly! Take us up with Thee.--------974
He looked for a city and lived in a tent,
A pilgrim to glory right onward he went;
God's promise his solace, so royal his birth,
No wonder he sought not the glories of earth.

  City! O city fair!
  God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.

He looked for a city, his God should prepare;
No mansion on earth, could he covet or share,
For had not God told him, that royal abode
Awaited His pilgrims on ending the road.

  City! O city fair!
  God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.

He looked for a city; if sometimes he sighed
To be trudging the road, all earth's glory denied,
The thought of that city changed sighing to song,
For the road might be rough, but it could not be long.

  City! O city fair!
  God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.

He looked for a city, his goal, Lord, we share
And know that bright city, which Thou dost prepare
Is ever our portion, since willing to be
Just pilgrims with Jesus, our roof a tent tree.

  City! O city fair!
  God's dwelling with man to eternity is there.--------975
It was a garden in the primal age,
But at the end it is a city square;
Creation's center in the garden was,
God's building issues in the city fair.

Both in the garden and the city fair
A river and the tree of life are seen,
Christ typifying as the life supply,
The Spirit showing as the living stream.

Both in the garden and the city bright
Three kinds of precious substances are found;
There are the gold, the pearls, and precious stones
Which for the building work of God abound.

But in the garden all these precious things
Are just materials lying in the earth,
Yet in the city all are builded up
And form that dwelling of transcendent worth.

Man in the garden of the clay was formed,
In nature as the Lord created him;
The tree of life was then without the man,
Not having yet become his life within.

But in the city glorious the tree
Within the corporate "man" doth grow, thereby
Revealing Christ Himself as life divine
Being to man his inward life supply.

'Tis for the city man is wrought upon,
Therefore regenerated and transformed
To purest gold, to pearls and precious stones,
As Christ's own Body, to Himself conformed.

Within the garden also was a bride,
Who was to Adam as his counterpart;
Lastly, the city is itself the bride
As Christ's own fulness, precious to His heart.

The city is God's building work replete,
A composition of the justified;
A habitation it affords to God
And is to Christ His own beloved bride.

10 'Tis God's expression, ultimate and full,
Corporate and universal, marvelous;
God's glory it completely manifests,
And is Christ's counterpart most glorious.--------976
O Lord Jesus, Thy redeemed ones
Are Thy Body and Thy Bride;
As Thy fulness, Thine expression,
In her Thou art glorified.
Thou, her all in all forever,
She Thy riches doth declare;
Thou dost fully saturate her
And Thy glory with her share.

  Lo, the holy city,
  Full of God's bright glory!
  It is God's complete expression
  In humanity.

God with man completely blended,
Mystery of godliness,
God in glory, full, resplendent,
Man, His dwelling, doth express.
'Tis a vessel universal
All God's fulness to express;
All His beauty manifesting,
Mingled with His holiness.

  Lo, the holy city,
  Full of God's bright glory!
  It is God's complete expression
  In humanity.

'Tis a living composition
Of the saints He hath transformed;
As the pearls and stones most precious,
To His image they're conformed:
From the throne of God, its center,
Flows the living water free;
Christ the tree of life doth flourish,
Bearing fruit abundantly.

  Lo, the holy city,
  Full of God's bright glory!
  It is God's complete expression
  In humanity.

'Tis th' eternal golden lampstand,
Holding Christ, the lamp of light;
God in Christ the light of glory
As the Spirit shineth bright!
'Tis the ultimate expression
Man in God and God in man;
'Tis their mutual habitation,
Goal of God's eternal plan.

  Lo, the holy city,
  Full of God's bright glory!
  It is God's complete expression
  In humanity.--------977
Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Holy city of our God;
He whose word cannot be broken
Formed thee for His own abode;
On the Rock of Ages founded,
What can shake thy sure repose?
With salvation's walls surrounded,
Thou may'st smile at all thy foes.

See the streams of living waters,
Springing from eternal love,
Well supply thy blessed members,
And all fear of want remove;
Who can faint, when such a river
Ever flows their thirst t' assuage?
Grace which, like the Lord, the giver,
Never fails from age to age.

Blest constituents of Zion,
Washed in the Redeemer's blood;
Jesus, whom their souls rely on,
Makes them kings and priests to God.
'Tis His love His people raises
Over self to reign as kings:
And as priests, His worthy praises,
Each his thankful offering brings.

Savior, if of Zion's city
I, through grace, a member am,
Let the world deride or pity
I will glory in Thy name.
Fading is the worldling's pleasure,
All his boasted pomp and show;
Solid joys and lasting treasure
None but Zion's members know.--------978
In new heaven and new earth
New Jerusalem lies;
Out of God it has its birth,
With God's radiance thrice.

  Lo, God's image it doth bear,
  And God's glory it doth share!
  And the Lord Himself is there
  In that city of God.

All the gates are pearls assigned
In the city of gold,
And the street is gold refined
With foundations twelvefold.

  Lo, God's image it doth bear,
  And God's glory it doth share!
  And the Lord Himself is there
  In that city of God.

There life's crystal river flows
With abundant supplies,
And the tree of life there grows
And all need satisfies.

  Lo, God's image it doth bear,
  And God's glory it doth share!
  And the Lord Himself is there
  In that city of God.

God is there the great I AM
In that city of light;
God's the light within the Lamb,
And there never is night.

  Lo, God's image it doth bear,
  And God's glory it doth share!
  And the Lord Himself is there
  In that city of God.--------979
How glorious, how bright it shines,
The holy, new Jerusalem;
It is God's dwelling place with man,
The spotless bride of Christ, the Lamb.

Saints of the Old and of the New,
Heirs of the promise God bestowed,
Components of the city are,
Together built for God's abode.

Perfectly square the city lies,
All sides are equal  length, width, height;
No measurement more long or short,
No part oblique, it stands upright.

The city with its street pure gold
As clear as glass transparent is,
Showing that God's transcendent life
Its quality and nature is.

Twelve city gates are each one pearl;
Thus man is through redemption shown
Reborn and as a pearl transformed,
Entering to a realm God's own.

The twelve foundations of its wall
Are with twelve precious stones adorned;
Through fire and pressure recomposed
And with eternal value formed.

The wall of jasper, crystal clear,
God's glory by it fully shown;
His glorious light through it does shine,
And He appears as jasper stone.

The wall a separation makes,
Excluding all that is unclean;
Gold, pearls, and precious stones alone
The holy city has within.

God and the Lamb the Temple are!
We shall behold His glorious face;
His presence never will depart,
We'll worship Him thru endless days.

10 The city needs no sun nor moon
For God's own glory is its light;
The Lamb's the lamp the city bears,
In all directions blazing bright.

11 Out from the throne of God and the Lamb
Flows midst the street a living stream,
And on its banks, on either side,
The tree of life is thriving seen.

12 This signifies the life of God
Not just for food or water flows,
But carries God's authority
As it throughout the city goes.

13 The street of purest gold therein
God's nature as the way doth show;
A river in it flows for drink
And fruits of life abundant grow.

14 The number twelve means government,
Perfection which eternal is;
God blent with man it also tells
Three multiplied by four shows this.

15 Darkness and death shall be no more,
Sorrow and pain shall pass away,
Old will be gone and all be new,
God will abide with man for aye.

16 The city has God's image full,
It rules for Him, the sovereign King,
Fulfilling His eternal plan,
Complete content to Him to bring.--------980
Throughout the whole of Holy Writ
The saints in type are manifest
As like a bride, God's heart to please,
And as a building for His rest.

The types and figures of the Church
In the Old Testament are these:
A building meet for life and rule,
A bride the man to match and please.

God's people in the ancient times
Were called by God His very spouse;
Among them and with them were built
God's ruling city and God's house.

Incarnate God, the God-man, Christ,
As Bridegroom for the Bride has come;
With His own life He quickened her,
That she His counterpart become.

In resurrection Christ doth now,
As David's Son, God's temple build,
That God may have a resting place
And there accomplish all He willed.

The Church is thus the Bride of Christ,
In whom His full delight doth rest;
It is a dwelling place to God
Where He may live and be expressed.

The new Jerusalem will be
The full perfection ultimate
Of all the types of house and bride,
Th' eternal plan to consummate.

It is the Bride which matches Christ,
Thru whom He may Himself express;
It is God's tabernacle too
In which our God can rule and rest.

The ultimate completion 'tis
Of God's work in humanity,
His full expression glorious
Thru His redeemed eternally.--------981
In His Christ to head up all things
Is our God's economy;
Taking Christ as Head and Center,
All is one in harmony.

Christ as Head will be the Center;
God within will be the Light;
Christ enthroned, with God, His substance,
Will fulfill His heart's delight.

Christ as life will be the content,
Heading up all things in light;
All the saints will be the vessel,
To express His glory bright.

Satan hath himself injected
Into man all things to spoil,
Bringing darkness and corruption
God's eternal plan to foil.

Christ has come, Himself imparting
Into man as life to save,
That the pow'r of death and darkness
May no more all things enslave.

Thru the Church which is His Body
Christ as Head will sum up all;
All will fitly join together,
All things either great or small.

Under Christ, by His full headship,
All in union will subsist;
In the light the Church expresses
All in oneness will exist.

Owning Christ as Head and Center,
All will be in harmony;
Thru the shining of His Body
All will share His liberty.

No more darkness and corruption,
No more death and vanity;
All will be released from bondage
Throughout all eternity.--------982
How true it is no heart may comprehend
The glory God prepareth for His own,
And what will happen when this age shall end;
But yet in vision Jesus hath made known
How fair and holy shall the Church descend,
Lit up with light of precious jasper stone.

And He shall make His Church all heavenly fair,
With gold and pearls, and every radiant stone,
And reign in holiness and glory there,
And shine as suns and stars have never shone;
And He shall lead His Bride, His joy and care,
With blissful singing to His Father's throne.

And then the blest communion shall have come,
Of God's dear children meeting from afar;
Within His burning love they blend as one,
Yet each, according as His counsels are,
Shall have peculiar glory of his own,
As one star differeth from another star.

And God is all in all in that great day,
And He is their exceeding great Reward;
Their stream of life, their beautiful array,
Their food, their joy, their radiance, Christ the Lord;
The music of their wondrous song shall say,
How great the joy that passeth thought or word.

And this is that eternal life of heaven,
Laid up with Christ in God, the mystery
Of resurrection life which He hath given:
A fount of living waters full and free;
A life by which the gates of death are riven,
A life which on the throne of Christ shall be.

And here in this waste wilderness begun,
So soon as we believe in Christ aright,
And quickened by the Spirit of the Son,
Receive Him as our only life and light,
As all the branches in the vine are one,
So we are one forever in His sight.

Now come, Lord Jesus, quickly from above,
Do Thou sustain us on the desert road,
And draw us after Thee by might of love,
Our Fatherland art Thou, O love of God;
Once safe in Thee, no more shall we remove,
O Thou our everlasting sure abode.--------983
There is a stream which issues forth
From God's eternal throne
And from the Lamb, a living stream,
Clear as the crystal stone.
In it doth grow the tree of life,
It makes the ransomed sing:
Its living draught revives the heart;
Hence all the joys do spring.

Such joys as are unspeakable,
And full of glory too;
Such splendid riches, meat and drink,
As worldlings do not know.
Eye hath not seen, nor ear hath heard,
For fancy 'tis concealed,
What Thou, Lord, hast laid up for Thine
And hast to me revealed.

I feel Thy touch, I hear Thy voice,
I taste Thy sweetest grace;
My soul doth leap: but, oh, that I
May see Thee face to face!
Then with the saints my soul shall feast
On joys that always last:
Blest be my God, the God of joy,
That gives here such a taste!--------984
River of living water,
River that flows from the throne,
Fellowship giving and making
God's own authority known.

  River of living water,
  Fellowship freely bestows;
  Bringing authority with it,
  Through every place where it flows.

Water of life is the Spirit,
God as the life in it flows;
Carrying with it His Lordship,
Through every place where it goes.

  River of living water,
  Fellowship freely bestows;
  Bringing authority with it,
  Through every place where it flows.

Midst the gold street it floweth,
Thus showing to us the way;
As in God's nature it floweth,
So in His way we will stay.

  River of living water,
  Fellowship freely bestows;
  Bringing authority with it,
  Through every place where it flows.

The tree of life by the river,
Shows to us God as our food;
We by the river's full flowing
Take of the tree's plenitude.

  River of living water,
  Fellowship freely bestows;
  Bringing authority with it,
  Through every place where it flows.--------985
No more in earthen vessels
God's treasure then shall be,
But in unclouded beauty
Thou, Lord, wilt shine thru me.

Afar thru that gold vessel
God's glory shineth bright;
There'll be no need of sunshine,
For God will be the light.

With Christ, the Stone most precious,
God's city shall be fair;
And He shall shine as jasper
In cloudless glory there:

Undimmed in that great vessel,
The glory of that light,
Illum'ning with its fulness
The earth in radiance bright.

All in His new creation
God's glory there shall see;
The vessel for that shining
The Lamb's own Bride shall be:

A golden vessel glorious,
That all who see adore
God in the Lamb in glory
Expressed forevermore.--------986
Christ has a full redemption made:
What a wonderful Savior!
We are redeemed! The price is paid:
What a wonderful Savior!

  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Savior;
  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Lord!

I praise Him for the cleansing blood,
What a wonderful Savior!
That reconciled my soul to God,
What a wonderful Savior!

  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,

What a wonderful Savior!
And keeps me faithful all the way,
What a wonderful Savior!

  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Savior;
  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Lord!

He gives me overcoming power,
What a wonderful Savior!
And triumph in each conflict hour,
What a wonderful Savior!

  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Savior;
  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Lord!

To Him I've given all my heart,
What a wonderful Savior!
The world shall never share a part,
What a wonderful Savior!

  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Savior;
  What a wonderful Savior is Jesus,
  my Lord!--------987
One day when heaven was filled with His praises,
One day when sin was as black as could be,
Jesus came forth to be born of a virgin
Dwelt among men, my example is He!

  Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
  Rising, He justified freely forever:
  One day He's coming  O glorious day!

One day they led Him up Calvary's mountain,
One day they nailed Him to die on the tree;
Suffering anguish, despised and rejected;
Bearing our sins, my Redeemer is He.

  Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
  Rising, He justified freely forever:
  One day He's coming  O glorious day!

One day they left Him alone in the garden,
One day He rested, from suffering free;
Angels came down o'er His tomb to keep vigil;
Hope of the hopeless, my Savior is He.

  Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
  Rising, He justified freely forever:
  One day He's coming  O glorious day!

One day the grave could conceal Him no longer,
One day the stone rolled away from the door;
Then He arose, over death He had conquered;
Now is ascended, my Lord evermore.

  Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
  Rising, He justified freely forever:
  One day He's coming  O glorious day!

One day the trumpet will sound for His coming,
One day the skies with His glory will shine;
Wonderful day, my beloved ones bringing;
Glorious Savior, this Jesus is mine!

  Living, He loved me; dying, He saved me;
  Buried, He carried my sins far away;
  Rising, He justified freely forever:
  One day He's coming  O glorious day!--------988
Merciful and loving,
Suff'ring pain and loss,
All for us, the sinners,
Going to the cross;
Tasting death for all men,
Dying for our sins;
This is Christ the Savior,
What will you do with Him?--------989
Jesus, my Savior, to Bethlehem came,
Laid in a manger to sorrow and shame;
O it was wonderful, blest be His name,
Seeking for me, for me:

  Seeking for me, for me,
  Seeking for me, for me;
  O it was wonderful, blest be His name,
  Seeking for me, for me.

Jesus, my Savior, on Calvary's tree
Paid the great debt, and my soul He set free;
O it was wonderful  how could it be?
Dying for me, for me!

  Dying for me, for me,
  Dying for me, for me;
  O it was wonderful  how could it be?
  Dying for me, for me!

Jesus, my Savior, the same as of old,
While I was wand'ring in darkness and cold,
Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
Calling for me, for me!

  Calling for me, for me,
  Calling for me, for me;
  Gently and long did He plead with my soul,
  Calling for me, for me!

Jesus, my Savior, shall come from on high.
Sweet is the promise as weary years fly:
O I shall see Him descend from the sky,
Coming for me, for me!

  Coming for me, for me,
  Coming for me, for me;
  O I shall see Him descend from the sky,
  Coming for me, for me!--------990
The Great Physician now is near,
The sympathizing Jesus;
He speaks the drooping heart to cheer,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus!

  Sweetest note in seraph song;
  Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
  Sweetest carol ever sung:
  Jesus, blessed Jesus!

Your many sins are all forgiv'n,
Oh, hear the voice of Jesus;
The veil 'twixt you and God is riven,
Redemption wrought by Jesus.

  Sweetest note in seraph song;
  Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
  Sweetest carol ever sung:
  Jesus, blessed Jesus!

All glory to the dying Lamb!
I now believe in Jesus;
I love the blessed Savior's name,
I love the name of Jesus.

  Sweetest note in seraph song;
  Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
  Sweetest carol ever sung:
  Jesus, blessed Jesus!

His name dispels my guilt and fear,
No other name but Jesus;
Oh, how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus!

  Sweetest note in seraph song;
  Sweetest name on mortal tongue;
  Sweetest carol ever sung:
  Jesus, blessed Jesus!--------991
We have heard the joyful sound:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Spread the tidings all around:
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!
Bear the news to every land,
Climb the steeps and cross the waves;
Onward!  'tis our Lord's command;
Jesus saves! Jesus saves!

Waft it on the rolling tide,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Tell to sinners far and wide,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Sing, ye islands of the sea,
Echo back, ye ocean caves;
Earth shall keep her jubilee,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

Sing above the battle's strife,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
By His death and endless life,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Sing it softly thru the gloom,
When the heart for mercy craves,
Sing in triumph o'er the tomb,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.

Give the winds a mighty voice,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Let the nations now rejoice.
Jesus saves, Jesus saves;
Shout salvation full and free,
Highest hills and deepest caves,
This our song of victory,
Jesus saves, Jesus saves.--------992
There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
No, not one! no, not one!
None else could heal all our souls' diseases:
No, not one! no, not one!

  Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide till the day is done:
  There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!

No friend like Him is so high and holy,
No, not one! no, not one!
And yet no friend is so meek and lowly,
No, not one! no, not one!

  Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide till the day is done:
  There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!

There's not an hour that He is not near us,
No, not one! no, not one!
No night so dark, but His love can cheer us,
No, not one! no, not one!

  Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide till the day is done:
  There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!

Did ever saint find this Friend forsake him?
No, not one! no, not one!
Or sinner find that He would not take him?
No, not one! no, not one!

  Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide till the day is done:
  There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!

Was e'er a gift like the Savior given?
No, not one! No, not one!
Will He refuse us the bliss of heaven?
No, not one! No, not one!

  Jesus knows all about our struggles;
  He will guide till the day is done:
  There's not a Friend like the lowly Jesus:
  No, not one! no, not one!--------993
O how sweet the glorious message,
Simple faith my claim;
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same.
Still He loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, still the tempest;
Glory to His name!

  Yesterday, today, forever,
  Jesus is the same,
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name.

He who was the friend of sinners,
Seeks thee, lost one, now;
Sinner, come, and at His footstool,
Penitently bow.
He who said, "I'll not condemn thee,
Go and sin no more,"
Speaks to thee that word of pardon,
As in days of yore.

  Yesterday, today, forever,
  Jesus is the same,
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name.

Oft on earth He healed the suff'rer,
By His mighty hand;
Still our sicknesses and sorrows,
Go at His command.
He who gave His healing virtue,
To a woman's touch;
To the faith that claims His fulness,
Still will give as much.

  Yesterday, today, forever,
  Jesus is the same,
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name.

As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide;
So through all life's way He walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again we shall behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But 'twill still be "this same Jesus,"
As he went away.

  Yesterday, today, forever,
  Jesus is the same,
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  All may change, but Jesus never!
  Glory to His name.--------994
Oh, how dark the night that wrapt my spirit round!
Oh, how deep the woe my Savior found
When He walked across the waters of my soul,
Bade my night disperse and made me whole!

  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He went for me, He went for me;
  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He died to set me free.

Tremblingly a sinner bowed before His face,
Naught I knew of pardon, God's free grace;
Heard a voice so melting, "Cease thy wild regret,
Jesus bought thy pardon, paid thy debt."

  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He went for me, He went for me;
  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He died to set me free.

O 'twas wondrous love the Savior showed for me!
When He left His throne for Calvary,
When He bore my trespass, bore it all alone;
Praise His name forever, make it known.

  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He went for me, He went for me;
  All the way to Calvary He went for me,
  He died to set me free.--------995
There is a green hill far away,
Without a city wall,
Where the dear Lord was crucified,
Who died to save us all.

  Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
  And died our sins to bear;
  We trust in His redeeming blood,
  And life eternal share.

We may not know, we cannot tell,
What pains He had to bear;
But we believe it was for us,
He hung and suffered there.

  Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
  And died our sins to bear;
  We trust in His redeeming blood,
  And life eternal share.

He died that we might be forgiven,
He died to make us good,
That we might from our sins be freed,
Saved by His precious blood.

  Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
  And died our sins to bear;
  We trust in His redeeming blood,
  And life eternal share.

There was no other good enough
To pay the price of sin,
He only could divine life give
And dwell Himself within.

  Oh, dearly, dearly has He loved,
  And died our sins to bear;
  We trust in His redeeming blood,
  And life eternal share.--------996
Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
Bearer of the sinner's load,
Breaker of the captive's chain,
Cleanser of the guilty's stain.

Thou the sinner's death hast died,
Thou for us wast crucified;
For our sins Thy flesh was torn,
Thou our penalty hast borne.

Savior, Surety, Lamb of God,
Thou hast bought us with Thy blood;
Thou hast wiped the debt away,
Nothing left for us to pay;

Nothing left for us to bear,
Nothing left for us to share
But the pardon and the bliss,
But the love, the light, the peace.

I to Thee will look and live,
And, in looking, praises give;
Looking lightens, looking heals,
Looking all the gladness seals.

Jesus, Savior, Son of God,
Bearer of the sinner's load,
I would rise to Thee above,
I would look, and praise, and love.--------997
I hear the Savior say,
"Thy strength indeed is small,
Child of weakness, watch and pray,
Find in Me thine all in all."

  Jesus paid it all,
  All to Him I owe;
  Sin had left a crimson stain,
  He washed it white as snow.

Lord, now indeed I find
Thy pow'r, and Thine alone,
Can change the leper's spots,
And melt the heart of stone.

  Jesus paid it all,
  All to Him I owe;
  Sin had left a crimson stain,
  He washed it white as snow.

For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim
I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calv'ry's Lamb.

  Jesus paid it all,
  All to Him I owe;
  Sin had left a crimson stain,
  He washed it white as snow.

And when, before the throne,
I stand in Him complete,
"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat.

  Jesus paid it all,
  All to Him I owe;
  Sin had left a crimson stain,
  He washed it white as snow.--------998
Christ has become one with sinners,
Sharing in all of our living;
Crucified even for sinners,
Glorious life to us giving.

  Christ Jesus came for us,
  Christ Jesus died for us;
  O yes, for us, for us, for us.
  Christ came and died for us.--------999
Alas, and did my Savior bleed?
And did my Sovereign die?
Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

  At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
  And the burden of my heart rolled away,
  It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!

Was it for sins that I had done
He groaned upon the tree?
Amazing pity! Grace unknown!
And love beyond degree!

  At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
  And the burden of my heart rolled away,
  It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!

Well might the sun in darkness hide,
And shut His glories in,
When Christ, the mighty Maker, died
For man, His creature's sin.

  At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
  And the burden of my heart rolled away,
  It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!

Thus might I hide my blushing face
While His dear cross appears.
Dissolve my heart in thankfulness,
And melt mine eyes to tears.

  At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
  And the burden of my heart rolled away,
  It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!

But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe;
Here, Lord, I give myself away,
'Tis all that I can do.

  At the cross, at the cross where
  I first saw the light,
  And the burden of my heart rolled away,
  It was there by faith I received my sight,
  And now I am happy all the day!--------1000
Working will not save me;
Purest deeds that I can do,
Holiest thoughts and feelings too,
Cannot form my soul anew;
Working will not save me.

  Jesus wept and died for me;
  Jesus suffered on the tree;
  Jesus waits to make me free,
  He alone can save me.

Weeping will not save me;
Though my face were bathed in tears,
That could not allay my fears,
Could not wash the sins of years;
Weeping will not save me.

  Jesus wept and died for me;
  Jesus suffered on the tree;
  Jesus waits to make me free,
  He alone can save me.

Waiting will not save me;
Helpless, guilty, lost I lie,
In my ear is mercy's cry;
If I wait I can but die:
Waiting will not save me.

  Jesus wept and died for me;
  Jesus suffered on the tree;
  Jesus waits to make me free,
  He alone can save me.

Praying will not save me;
All the prayers that I could say
Could not wash my sins away,
All I owe could never pay:
Praying will not save me.

  Jesus wept and died for me;
  Jesus suffered on the tree;
  Jesus waits to make me free,
  He alone can save me.

Faith in Christ will save me;
Let me trust Thy gracious Son,
Trust the work that He has done,
To His arms, Lord, help me run;
Faith in Christ will save me.

  Jesus wept and died for me;
  Jesus suffered on the tree;
  Jesus waits to make me free,
  He alone can save me.--------1001
Free from the law  oh, happy condition!
Jesus hath bled, and there is remission;
Cursed by the law and bruised by the fall,
Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

  Once for all  oh, sinner, receive it;
  Once for all  oh, doubter, believe it;
  Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

There on the cross your burden upbearing,
Thorns on His brow your Savior is wearing;
Never again your sin need appall,
You have been pardoned once for all.

  Once for all  oh, sinner, receive it;
  Once for all  oh, doubter, believe it;
  Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

Now we are free  there's no condemnation;
Jesus provides a perfect salvation:
"Come unto Me," oh, hear His sweet call,
Come, and He saves us once for all.

  Once for all  oh, sinner, receive it;
  Once for all  oh, doubter, believe it;
  Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.

Children of man  oh, glorious calling,
Surely His grace will keep us from falling;
Passing from death to life at His call,
Blessed salvation once for all.

  Once for all  oh, sinner, receive it;
  Once for all  oh, doubter, believe it;
  Cling to the cross, the burden will fall,
  Christ hath redeemed us once for all.--------1002
Nothing either great or small
Nothing, sinner, no;
Jesus did it, did it all,
Long, long ago.

  "It is finished!" yes, indeed,
  Finished every jot:
  Sinner, this is all you need
  Tell me, is it not?

When He, from His lofty throne,
Stooped to do and die,
Everything was fully done;
Hearken to His cry:

  "It is finished!" yes, indeed,
  Finished every jot:
  Sinner, this is all you need
  Tell me, is it not?

Weary, working, burdened one,
Wherefore toil you so?
Cease your doing; all was done
Long, long ago.

  "It is finished!" yes, indeed,
  Finished every jot:
  Sinner, this is all you need
  Tell me, is it not?

Till to Jesus' work you cling
By a simple faith,
"Doing" is a deadly thing
"Doing" ends in death.

  "It is finished!" yes, indeed,
  Finished every jot:
  Sinner, this is all you need
  Tell me, is it not?

Cast your deadly "doing" down
Down at Jesus' feet;
Stand in Him, in Him alone,
Gloriously complete.

  "It is finished!" yes, indeed,
  Finished every jot:
  Sinner, this is all you need
  Tell me, is it not?--------1003
Why should I worry, doubt and fear?
Has God not caused His Son to bear
My sins upon the tree?
The debt that Christ for me has paid,
Would God another mind have made
To claim again from me?

Redemption full the Lord has made,
And all my debts has fully paid,
From law to set me free.
I fear not for the wrath of God,
For I've been sprinkled with His blood,
It wholly covers me.

For me forgiveness He has gained,
And full acquittal was obtained,
All debts of sin are paid;
God would not have His claim on two,
First on His Son, my Surety true,
And then upon me laid.

So now I have full peace and rest,
My Savior Christ hath done the best
And set me wholly free;
By His all-efficacious blood
I ne'er could be condemned by God,
For He has died for me!--------1004

Christ our Redeemer died on the cross,
Died for the sinner, paid all his due;
Sprinkle your soul with the blood of the Lamb,
"And I will pass, will pass over your."

  "When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  I will pass, I will pass over you."

Chiefest of sinners, Jesus will save;
All He has promised, that will He do;
Wash in the fountain opened for sin,
"And I will pass, will pass over you."

  "When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  I will pass, I will pass over you."

Judgment is coming, all will be there,
Each one receiving justly his due;
Hide in the saving, sin-cleansing blood,
"And I will pass, will pass over you."

  "When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  I will pass, I will pass over you."

O great compassion! O boundless love!
O loving kindness, faithful and true!
Find peace and shelter under the blood,
"And I will pass, will pass over you."

  "When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  When I see the blood,
  I will pass, I will pass over you."--------1006
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel's veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed ones of God
Be saved, to sin no more:
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed ones of God
Be saved to sin no more.

E'er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save:
I'll sing Thy power to save,
I'll sing Thy power to save;
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I'll sing Thy power to save.--------1007

O now I see the cleansing wave!
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
Points to His wounded side.

  The cleansing stream I see, I see;
  I plunge, and O it cleanseth me!

And quickened by its flood.

One day soothe, the next day grieve us;

Never to fade or fall,
Till into the rest of the house of God

  Boundless, and pure, and free;
  Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
  Jesus pleadeth for thee.

There is no heart like the heart of Jesus,
Filled with a tender love;
No throb nor throe that our hearts can know,
But He feels it above.

  Jesus' love, precious love,
  Boundless, and pure, and free;
  Oh, turn to that love, weary wand'ring soul;
  Jesus pleadeth for thee.

Oh, what a Savior that He died for me!
From condemnation He hath made me free;
"He that believeth on the Son" saith He,
"Hath everlasting life."

  "Verily, verily, I say unto you;"
  "Verily, verily," message ever new!
  "He that believeth on the Son"  'tis true!

All my iniquities on Him were laid,
All my indebtedness by Him was paid;
All who believe on Him, the Lord hath said,
"Hath everlasting life."

  "Verily, verily," message ever new!
  "He that believeth on the Son"  'tis true!

Under the burdens of guilt and care,
Many a spirit is grieving,
Who in the joy of the Lord might share,
Life everlasting receiving.

  Life! Life! Eternal life!
  Jesus alone is the Giver:
  Life! Life! Abundant life!
  Glory to Jesus forever!

Burdened one, why will you longer bear
Sorrows from which He releases?
Open your heart, and rejoicing, share
Life more abundant in Jesus.

  Life! Life! Eternal life!
  Jesus alone is the Giver:
  Life! Life! Abundant life!
  Glory to Jesus forever!

Leaving the mountain, the streamlet grows,
Flooding the vale with a river;
So, from the hill of the Cross, there flows
Life more abundant forever.

  Life! Life! Eternal life!
  Jesus alone is the Giver:
  Life! Life! Abundant life!
  Glory to Jesus forever!

Oh, for the flood on the thirsty land!
Oh, for a mighty revival!
Oh, for a sanctified, fearless band,
Ready to hail its arrival!

  Life! Life! Eternal life!
  Jesus alone is the Giver:
  Life! Life! Abundant life!
  Glory to Jesus forever!--------1017
  Christ has put on human nature and become a man like me,

  Vict'ry! Vict'ry! Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry! Vict'ry! Hallelujah!

The whole world was lost in the darkness of sin;
The light of the world is Jesus;
Like sunshine at noonday His glory shone in,
The light of the world is Jesus.

  Come to the light, 'tis shining for thee;
  Sweetly the light has dawned upon me;
  Once I was blind, but now I can see;
  The light of the world is Jesus.

No darkness have we who in Jesus abide,
The light of the world is Jesus;
We walk in the light when we follow our Guide,
The light of the world is Jesus.

  Come to the light, 'tis shining for thee;
  Sweetly the light has dawned upon me;
  Once I was blind, but now I can see;
  The light of the world is Jesus.

Ye dwellers in darkness with sin-blinded eyes,
The light of the world is Jesus;
Go, wash, at His bidding, and light will arise;
The light of the world is Jesus.

  Come to the light, 'tis shining for thee;
  Sweetly the light has dawned upon me;
  Once I was blind, but now I can see;
  The light of the world is Jesus.--------1019
A ruler once came to Jesus by night,
To ask Him the way of salvation and light;
The Master made answer in words true and plain,
"Ye must be born again!"

  "Ye must be born again!"
  "Ye must be born again!"
  "I verily, verily say unto thee,
  Ye must be born again!"

Ye children of men, attend to the word
So solemnly uttered by Jesus, the Lord,
And let not this message to you be in vain,
"Ye must be born again."

  "Ye must be born again!"
  "Ye must be born again!"
  "I verily, verily say unto thee,
  Ye must be born again!"

Oh, ye who would enter that glorious rest,
And sing with the ransomed the song of the blest;
The life everlasting if ye would obtain,
"Ye must be born again."

  "Ye must be born again!"
  "Ye must be born again!"
  "I verily, verily say unto thee,
  Ye must be born again!"--------1020
Who can set us free from sin?
Only Christ! Only Christ!
Who can be our life within?
Only Christ!
Only Christ! Only Christ!
Only Christ can set us free,
Only Christ!--------1021
All sinners are the slaves of sin,
All poisoned by death's sting;
Christ only can from sin and death
A full deliverance bring.
He is the Everlasting One,
Who longs to set us free;
If we do not believe in Him,
We'll die in misery.--------1022
I've tried in vain a thousand ways
My fears to quell, my hopes to raise;
But what I need, the Bible says,
Is ever, only Jesus.

My soul is night, my heart is steel
I cannot see, I cannot feel;
For light, for life I must appeal
In simple faith to Jesus.

He died, He lives, He reigns, He pleads;
There's love in all His words and deeds;
There's all a guilty sinner needs
Forevermore in Jesus.

Though some should sneer, and some should blame,
I'll go with all my guilt and shame;
I'll go to Him because His name,
Above all names, is Jesus.--------1023
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My spirit dead within:
I need the cleansing fountain,
Where I can always flee:
The blood of Christ most precious,
The sinner's perfect plea.

I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
I have no earthly store:
I need the love of Jesus,
To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps,
To be my strength and stay.

I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need a friend like Thee;
A friend to soothe and comfort,
A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus,
To feel each anxious care,
To bear my every burden,
And all my sorrow share.

I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fulness,
To lead me on my way;
I need Thy Holy Spirit,
To teach me what I am;
To show me more of Jesus,
To point me to the Lamb.

I need Thee, precious Jesus!
And hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with Thy glory,
And seated on Thy throne;
There with Thy blood-bought people,
My joy shall ever be
To praise Thee, precious Jesus,
To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.--------1024
Christ the Savior is just the One you need,
He's God incarnate, as a man indeed;
In His body He suffered every pain
And died to cleanse your every stain,
So you need Jesus!

  You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
  For redemption you need Him,
  For salvation you need Him!
  And for everlasting life,
  Yes, you need Jesus!

He has risen and gone up into heav'n,
That life eternal might be fully giv'n;
Just receive Him, believing in your heart,
Then all you need He will impart,
So you need Jesus!

  You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
  For redemption you need Him,
  For salvation you need Him!
  And for everlasting life,
  Yes, you need Jesus!

He'll enlighten your darkened heart with light,
Forgive your sins and rescue you with might;
He will cleanse you from all stains with His blood,
And give to you the life of God,
So you need Jesus!

  You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
  For redemption you need Him,
  For salvation you need Him!
  And for everlasting life,
  Yes, you need Jesus!

In your living there is a lack you sense,
And thru the years it grows the more intense;
Only Jesus this need can satisfy;
All vanity He will defy,
So you need Jesus!

  You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
  To escape from vanity,
  To obtain reality,
  To make life significant,
  Yes, you need Jesus!

All this world now is rife with toil and pain,
In troubled times there's nothing to sustain;
All is empty, on what can you rely?
All things reveal and testify,
That you need Jesus!

  You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
  Men and women all need Him!
  To escape from vanity,
  To obtain reality,
  To make life significant,
  Yes, you need Jesus!--------1025
Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
He is your heart's very need;
What else can you desire or seek?
All things are empty indeed!

  He is so rich, He is so full,
  He can fulfill all your needs!
  He is so good, He is so sweet,
  All your desire He exceeds!

Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
He is the One you require;
Once you receive this glorious Christ,
Never the rest you'll desire.

  He is so rich, He is so full,
  He can fulfill all your needs!
  He is so good, He is so sweet,
  All your desire He exceeds!

Though very great is all the world,
And very small is your heart,
Yet the great world with all its wealth
Never can fill your small heart.

  He is so rich, He is so full,
  He can fulfill all your needs!
  He is so good, He is so sweet,
  All your desire He exceeds!

If you have Christ, you have all joys;
Without this Christ, only pains;
Where there is Christ there morning is;
Where He is not, night remains.

  He is so rich, He is so full,
  He can fulfill all your needs!
  He is so good, He is so sweet,
  All your desire He exceeds!--------1026

"Follow me, follow me, follow me;
For thee I trod the bitter way,
For thee I gave my life away,
And drank the gall thy debt to pay,
Follow me, follow me, follow me."

"I know thy life of guilt and pain;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
I know each ache of heart and brain;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
How often I have called in vain,
And offered pardon in my name,
And now I plead yet once again!
Follow me, follow me, follow me!"

"Though thou hast sinned I'll pardon thee;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
From every sin I'll set thee free;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
In all thy changing life I'll be
Thy God, thy guide on land and sea,
Thy bliss through all eternity,
Follow me, follow me, follow me!"

"Come, cast on Me thine every care;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
Thy heavy load I will upbear;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!
Come, look to Me  dismiss thy fears;
And trust Me through eternal years;
My hand shall wipe away thy tears;
Follow me, follow me, follow me!"

Dear Lord, I yield to Thee my will;
I'll follow Thee, follow thee, follow thee!
Oh, bid my struggling soul be still;
I'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!
Lord, cleanse me, with Thy Spirit fill,
And keep me safe from every ill;
And all Thy Word in me fulfill;
I'll follow Thee, follow Thee, follow Thee!--------1031
Come, every soul by sin oppressed,
There's mercy with the Lord;
And He will surely give you rest
By trusting in His Word.

  Only trust Him! Only trust Him!
  Only trust Him now!
  He will save you! He will save you!
  He will save you now!

For Jesus shed His precious blood
Rich blessings to bestow;
Plunge now into the crimson flood
That washeth white as snow.

  Only trust Him! Only trust Him!
  Only trust Him now!
  He will save you! He will save you!
  He will save you now!

Yes, Jesus is the Truth, the Way,
That leads you into rest;
Believe in Him without delay,
And you are fully blest.

  Only trust Him! Only trust Him!
  Only trust Him now!
  He will save you! He will save you!
  He will save you now!

Come then, and join the holy band,
And on to glory go;
In Christ's redemption take your stand,
And all His goodness know.

  Only trust Him! Only trust Him!
  Only trust Him now!
  He will save you! He will save you!
  He will save you now!--------1032
Come, ye sinners, poor and wretched,
Weak and wounded, sick and sore;
Jesus ready waits to save you,
Full of pity, love and pow'r:
He is able, He is able,
He is willing, doubt no more.

Come, ye needy, come and welcome;
God's free bounty glorify;
True belief and true repentance,
Every grace that brings us nigh,
Without money, without money,
Come to Jesus Christ and buy.

Let not conscience make you linger,
Nor of fitness fondly dream;
All the fitness He requireth
Is to feel your need of Him:
This He gives you, this He gives you,
'Tis the Spirit's rising beam.

Come, ye weary, heavy laden,
Lost and ruined by the fall;
If you tarry till you're better,
You will never come at all:
Not the righteous, not the righteous,
Sinners Jesus came to call.

Agonizing in the garden,
Your Redeemer prostrate lies;
On the bloody tree behold Him!
Hear Him cry, before He dies,
"It is finished!" "It is finished!"
Sinner, will not this suffice?

Lo! th' incarnate God, ascended,
Pleads the merit of His blood;
Venture on Him, venture wholly;
Let no other trust intrude:
None but Jesus, none but Jesus,
Can do helpless sinners good.--------1033
Ye who are troubled and burdened by sin,
Come just as you are;
Come to the Savior, a new life begin,
Oh, come just as you are.

  Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
  Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
  And come just as you are.

Deep in your heart sin has written its scar,
Come just as you are;
Though from the Father you've wandered afar,
Oh, come just as you are.

  Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
  Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
  And come just as you are.

Sinful and guilty, heart broken and lost,
Come just as you are;
Think what your ransom on Calvary cost!
Oh, come just as you are.

  Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
  Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
  And come just as you are.

Naught of your goodness God's favor can win,
Come just as you are;
Trust in the blood which was shed for your sin,
And come just as you are.

  Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
  Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
  And come just as you are.

Come with your heartache, your sorrow and pain,
Come just as you are;
No one has come to the Savior in vain,
Oh, come just as you are.

  Come just as you are,
  Oh, come just as you are;
  Give up your sin, let the Savior come in,
  And come just as you are.--------1034

There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
There is life at this moment for thee;
Then look, sinner, look unto Him and be saved,
Unto Him who was nailed to the tree.

  Look! Look! Look and live!
  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.

Oh, why was He there as the Bearer of sin,
If on Jesus thy guilt was not laid?
Oh, why from His side flowed the sin-cleansing blood,
If His dying thy debt has not paid?

  Look! Look! Look and live!
  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.

It is not thy tears of repentance or prayers,
But the blood, that redeemeth the soul;
On Him, then, who shed it, thou mayest at once
Thy weight of iniquities roll.

  Look! Look! Look and live!
  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.

Then doubt not thy welcome, since God has declared
There remaineth no more to be done;
That once in the end of the world He appeared,
And completed the work He begun.

  Look! Look! Look and live!
  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.

Then take with rejoicing from Jesus at once
The life everlasting He gives;
And know with assurance, thou never canst die
Since Jesus, thy Righteousness, lives.

  Look! Look! Look and live!
  There is life for a look at the Crucified One,
  There is life at this moment for thee.--------1036
Look to Jesus, weary one,
Look and live! Look and live!
Look at what the Lord has done,
Look and live!
See Him lifted on the tree,
Look and live! Look and live!
Hear Him say, "Look unto Me!"
Look and live!

  Look! The Lord is lifted high,
  Look to Him, He's ever nigh
  Look and live! Why will ye die?
  Look and live!

Though unworthy, vile, unclean,
Look and live! Look and live!
Look away from self and sin,
Look and live!
Long by Satan's power enslaved,
Look and live! Look and live!
Look to Me, ye shall be saved,
Look and live!

  Look! The Lord is lifted high,
  Look to Him, He's ever nigh
  Look and live! Why will ye die?
  Look and live!

Though you've wandered far away,
Look and live! Look and live!
Harden not your heart today,
Look and live!
'Tis thy Father calls thee home,
Look and live! Look and live!
Whosoever will may come,
Look and live!

  Look! The Lord is lifted high,
  Look to Him, He's ever nigh
  Look and live! Why will ye die?
  Look and live!--------1037
"Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow;
Though they be red as crimson,
They shall be as wool;"
"Though your sins be as scarlet,
Though your sins be as scarlet,
They shall be as white as snow,
They shall be as white as snow."

Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
He is of great compassion,
And of wondrous love;
Hear the voice that entreats you,
Hear the voice that entreats you,
O return ye unto God!
O return ye unto God!

He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more;
He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more;
"Look unto Me, ye people,"
Saith the Lord your God!
He'll forgive your transgressions,
He'll forgive your transgressions,
And remember them no more,
And remember them no more.--------1038

Let Him in;
He has been there oft before,
Let Him in;
Let Him in, ere He is gone,
Let Him in, the Holy One,
Jesus Christ, the Father's Son,
Let Him in.

Let Him in.

Hear you now His loving voice?
Let Him in;
Now, oh, now make Him your choice,

And when earth ties all are riv'n,
Comfort, rest, you will be giv'n,
Let Him in.--------1040
Hark, the Savior's knocking, knocking,
Knocking at your heart!
Oh, do not be hardened, hardened,
Lest He should depart.
Rise and open up your heart,
Quickly let Him in;
Life divine He'll give you, give you,
And forgive your sin.

  Let Him in! Let Him in!
  He's knocking at your heart;
  Let Him in! Oh, let Him in!
  Let Him in your heart.

Why should you still tarry, tarry,
Keep Him waiting there?
He is kind and gracious, gracious,
Merciful and dear.
Listen to His tender voice,
Do not grieve His heart;
Won't you let Him enter, enter,
And His grace impart.

  Let Him in! Let Him in!
  He's knocking at your heart;
  Let Him in! Oh, let Him in!
  Let Him in your heart.--------1041
Jesus is standing in Pilate's hall
Friendless, forsaken, betrayed by all:
Hearken! What meaneth the sudden call?
What will you do with Jesus?

  What will you do with Jesus?
  Neutral you cannot be;
  Some day your heart will be asking,
  "What will He do with me?"

Jesus is standing on trial still,
You can be false to Him if you will,
You can be faithful through good or ill:
What will you do with Jesus?

  What will you do with Jesus?
  Neutral you cannot be;
  Some day your heart will be asking,
  "What will He do with me?"

Will you evade Him as Pilate tried?
Or will you choose Him, whate'er betide?
Vainly you struggle from Him to hide:
What will you do with Jesus?

  What will you do with Jesus?
  Neutral you cannot be;
  Some day your heart will be asking,
  "What will He do with me?"

Will you, like Peter, your Lord deny?
Or will you scorn from His foes to fly,
Daring for Jesus to live or die?
What will you do with Jesus?

  What will you do with Jesus?
  Neutral you cannot be;
  Some day your heart will be asking,
  "What will He do with me?"

"Jesus, I give Thee my heart today!
Jesus, I'll follow Thee all the way,
Gladly obeying Thee!" will you say:
"This will I do with Jesus!"

  What will you do with Jesus?
  Neutral you cannot be;
  Some day your heart will be asking,
  "What will He do with me?"--------1042
While we pray and while we plead,
While you see your soul's deep need,
While our Father calls you home,
Will you not to Jesus come?

  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?
  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?

You have wandered far away;
Do not risk another day;
Do not turn from God thy face,
But today accept His grace.

  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?
  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?

In the world you've failed to find
Aught of peace for troubled mind;
Come to Christ, on Him believe,
Peace and joy you shall receive.

  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?
  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?

Come to Christ, confession make;
Come to Christ, and pardon take;
Trust in Him from day to day,
He will keep you all the way.

  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?
  Why not now? Why not now?
  Why not come to Jesus now?--------1043
Life at best is very brief,
Like the falling of a leaf,
Like the binding of a sheaf,
Be in time!
Fleeting days are telling fast
That the die will soon be cast,
And the fatal line be passed,
Be in time!

  Be in time! Be in time!
  While the voice of Jesus calls you,
  Be in time!
  If in sin you longer wait,
  You may find no open gate,
  And your cry be just too late:
  Be in time!

Fairest flowers soon decay,
Youth and beauty pass away;
O you have not long to stay,
Be in time!
While God's Spirit bids you come,
Sinner, do not longer roam,
Lest you seal your hopeless doom,
Be in time!

  Be in time! Be in time!
  While the voice of Jesus calls you,
  Be in time!
  If in sin you longer wait,
  You may find no open gate,
  And your cry be just too late:
  Be in time!

Time is gliding swiftly by,
Death and judgment draweth nigh,
To the arms of Jesus fly,
Be in time!
O I pray you count the cost!
Ere the fatal line be crossed,
And your soul in hell be lost,
Be in time!

  Be in time! Be in time!
  While the voice of Jesus calls you,
  Be in time!
  If in sin you longer wait,
  You may find no open gate,
  And your cry be just too late:
  Be in time!

Sinner, heed the warning voice,
Make the Lord your final choice,
Then all heaven will rejoice,
Be in time!
Come from darkness into light;
Come, let Jesus make you right;
Come, receive His life tonight,
Be in time!

  Be in time! Be in time!
  While the voice of Jesus calls you,
  Be in time!
  If in sin you longer wait,
  You may find no open gate,
  And your cry be just too late:
  Be in time!--------1044
Are you ready God to meet?
Are you ready God to meet?
Are you ready God to meet,
Ready God to meet?
Are you ready, are you ready,
Ready God to meet?--------1045
O do not let the Word depart,
And close thine eyes against the light:
Poor sinner, harden not your heart,
Be saved, O tonight.

  O why not tonight?
  O why not tonight?
  Wilt thou be saved?
  Then why not tonight?

Tomorrow's sun may never rise
To bless thy long-deluded sight;
This is the time, O then be wise,
Be saved, O tonight.

  O why not tonight?
  O why not tonight?
  Wilt thou be saved?
  Then why not tonight?

Our Lord in pity lingers still,
And wilt thou thus His love requite?
Renounce at once thy stubborn will,
Be saved, O tonight.

  O why not tonight?
  O why not tonight?
  Wilt thou be saved?
  Then why not tonight?

Our blessed Lord refuses none
Who would to Him their souls unite;
Believe on Him, the work is done.
Be saved, O tonight.

  O why not tonight?
  O why not tonight?
  Wilt thou be saved?
  Then why not tonight?--------1046
"Almost persuaded" now to believe;
"Almost persuaded" Christ to receive;
Seems now some soul to say,
"Go, Spirit, go Thy way,
Some more convenient day
On Thee I'll call."

"Almost persuaded" come, come today;
"Almost persuaded," turn not away;
Jesus invites you here,
Angels are ling'ring near,
Prayers rise from hearts so dear;
O wand'rer come!

Oh, be persuaded! Christ never fails
Oh, be persuaded! His blood avails
Can save from every sin,
Cleanse you without, within
Will you not let Him in?
Open the door!

"Almost persuaded," harvest is past!
"Almost persuaded," doom comes at last;
"Almost" cannot avail;
"Almost" is but to fail!
Sad, sad that bitter wail
"Almost  but lost!"

Be now persuaded, oh, sinner, hear!
Be now persuaded, Jesus is near;
His voice is pleading still,
Turn now with heart and will,
Peace will your spirit fill
Oh, turn today!--------1047
Eternity! Eternity!
How will you spend Eternity?
This question comes to you and me!
How will you spend Eternity?
Tell me, what shall your answer be
How will you spend Eternity?

Eternity! Eternity!
How will you spend Eternity?
Many are choosing Christ today,
Turning from all their sins away;
Christ shall their blessed portion be:
How will you spend Eternity?

Eternity! Eternity!
How will you spend Eternity?
Leaving the strait and narrow way,
Going the downward road today,
What shall the final ending be
How will you spend Eternity?

Eternity! Eternity!
How will you spend Eternity?
Turn, and believe this very hour,
Trust in the Savior's grace and power:
Then shall your joyous answer be,
Saved through a long Eternity!--------1048
Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,
And that Thou bid'st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot;
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt;
Fightings within, and fears without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind;
Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!--------1049
Drawn to the Cross which Thou hast blest,
With healing gifts for souls distrest,
To find in Thee my Life, my Rest,
Christ crucified, I come.

Stained with the sins which I have wrought
In word and deed and secret thought;
For pardon which Thy Blood hath bought,
Christ crucified, I come.

Weary of selfishness and pride,
False pleasures gone, vain hopes denied,
Deep in Thy wounds my shame to hide,
Christ crucified, I come.

Thou knowest all my griefs and fears,
Thy grace abused, my misspent years;
Yet now to Thee, for cleansing tears,
Christ crucified, I come.

I would not, if I could, conceal
The ills which only Thou canst heal;
So to the Cross, where sinners kneel,
Christ crucified, I come.

Wash me, and take away each stain,
Let nothing of my sin remain;
For cleansing, though it be through pain,
Christ crucified, I come.

To share with Thee Thy life divine,
Thy very likeness to be mine,
Since Thou hast made my nature Thine,
Christ crucified, I come.

To be what Thou wouldst have me be,
Accepted, sanctified in Thee,
Through what Thy grace shall work in me,
Christ crucified, I come.--------1050
Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into Thy freedom, gladness, and light,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of my sickness into Thy health,
Out of my want and into Thy wealth,
Out of my sin and into Thyself,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of my shameful failure and loss,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the glorious gain of Thy cross,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of earth's sorrows into Thy balm,
Out of life's storm and into Thy calm,
Out of distress to jubilant psalm,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of unrest and arrogant pride,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into Thy blessed will to abide,
Jesus I come to Thee!
Out of myself to dwell in Thy love,
Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come! Jesus, I come!
Into the joy and pleasure, Thine own,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the flock Thy love doth enfold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee!--------1051
I hear Thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.

  I am coming, Lord,
  Coming now to Thee:
  Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
  That flowed on Calvary.

Though coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all, and pure.

  I am coming, Lord,
  Coming now to Thee:
  Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
  That flowed on Calvary.

'Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
Where reigned the power of sin.

  I am coming, Lord,
  Coming now to Thee:
  Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
  That flowed on Calvary.

And He the witness gives
To loyal hearts and free,
That every promise is fulfilled,
If faith but brings the plea.

  I am coming, Lord,
  Coming now to Thee:
  Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
  That flowed on Calvary.

All hail, redeeming blood!
All hail, life-giving grace!
All hail, the gift of Christ our Lord,
Our strength and righteousness.

  I am coming, Lord,
  Coming now to Thee:
  Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
  That flowed on Calvary.--------1052
I've wandered far away from God,
Now I'm coming home;
The paths of sin too long I've trod,
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.

I've wasted many precious years,
Now I'm coming home;
I now repent with bitter tears,
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.

I'm tired of sin and straying, Lord,
Now I'm coming home;
I'll trust Thy love, believe Thy word;
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.

My soul is sick, my heart is sore,
Now I'm coming home;
My strength renew, my hope restore:
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.

My only hope, my only plea,
Now I'm coming home;
That Jesus died, and died for me;
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.

I need His cleansing blood, I know,
Now I'm coming home;
O wash me whiter than the snow;
Lord, I'm coming home.

  Coming home, coming home,
  Nevermore to roam;
  Open wide Thine arms of love;
  Lord, I'm coming home.--------1053
With broken heart and contrite sigh,
A trembling sinner, Lord, I cry;
Thy pard'ning grace is rich and free:
O God, be merciful to me!

I smite upon my troubled breast,
With deep and conscious guilt oppressed;
Christ and His cross my only plea:
O God, be merciful to me!

Far off I stand with tearful eyes,
Nor dare uplift them to the skies;
But Thou dost all my anguish see,
O God, be merciful to me!

With alms, or deeds that I have done,
Not one sin's pardon can be won;
To Calvary alone I flee;
O God, be merciful to me!

And when redeemed from sin and hell,
With all the ransomed throng I dwell,
My raptured song shall ever be,
God has been merciful to me!--------1054
Pass me not, O gentle Savior,
Hear my humble cry;
While on others Thou art calling,
Do not pass me by.

  Savior, Savior,
  Hear my humble cry;
  While on others Thou art calling,
  Do not pass me by.

Let me at Thy throne of mercy
Find a sweet relief;
Kneeling there in deep contrition,
Help my unbelief.

  Savior, Savior,
  Hear my humble cry;
  While on others Thou art calling,
  Do not pass me by.

Trusting only in Thy merit,
Would I seek Thy face;
Heal my wounded, broken spirit,
Save me by Thy grace.

  Savior, Savior,
  Hear my humble cry;
  While on others Thou art calling,
  Do not pass me by.

Thou the spring of all my comfort,
More than life to me;
Whom have I on earth beside Thee?
Whom in heaven but Thee?

  Savior, Savior,
  Hear my humble cry;
  While on others Thou art calling,
  Do not pass me by.--------1055
I am sinful, I am helpless,
Humbly at Thy feet I bow;
Full of problems, I am hopeless,
Oh, dear Savior, save me now!
Save me now! Save me now!
Oh, dear Savior, save me now!
Save me now from all my problems,
Oh, dear Savior, save me now!--------1056
Jesus, my Lord, to Thee I cry;
Unless Thou save me, I must die:
Oh, bring Thy free salvation nigh,
And take me as I am!

  And take me as I am!
  And take me as I am!
  My only plea  Christ died for me!
  Oh, take me as I am!

Helpless I am, and full of guilt;
But yet for me Thy blood was spilt,
And Thou canst make me what Thou wilt,
And take me as I am.

  And take me as I am!
  And take me as I am!
  My only plea  Christ died for me!
  Oh, take me as I am!

No preparation can I make,
My best resolves I only break,
Yet save me for Thine own Name's sake,
And take me as I am.

  And take me as I am!
  And take me as I am!
  My only plea  Christ died for me!
  Oh, take me as I am!

Behold me, Savior, at Thy feet,
Deal with me as Thou seest meet;
Thy work begin, Thy work complete,
But take me as I am.

  And take me as I am!
  And take me as I am!
  My only plea  Christ died for me!
  Oh, take me as I am!--------1057
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high:
Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide;
O receive my soul at last.

Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, oh, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

Thou, O Christ, art all I want;
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy name,
I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full of sin I am,
Thou art full of truth and grace.

Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart,
Rise to all eternity.--------1058
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee;
Let the water and the blood,
From Thy riven side which flowed,
Be of sin the double cure,
Save me from its guilt and power.

Not the labor of my hands
Can fulfill Thy law's demands;
Could my zeal no respite know,
Could my tears forever flow,
All could never sin erase,
Thou must save, and save by grace.

Nothing in my hands I bring,
Simply to Thy cross I cling;
Naked, come to Thee for dress,
Helpless, look to Thee for grace:
Foul, I to the fountain fly,
Wash me, Savior, or I die.

While I draw this fleeting breath,
When mine eyes shall close in death,
When I soar to worlds unknown,
See Thee on Thy judgment throne,
Rock of Ages, cleft for me,
Let me hide myself in Thee.--------1059
Jesus, keep me near the cross,
There a precious fountain,
Free to all  a healing stream,
Flows from Calv'ry's mountain.

  In the cross, in the cross,
  Be my glory ever;
  From the cross my ransomed soul
  Nothing then shall sever.

Near the cross, a trembling soul,
Love and mercy found me;
There the Bright and Morning Star
Sheds its beams around me.

  In the cross, in the cross,
  Be my glory ever;
  From the cross my ransomed soul
  Nothing then shall sever.

Near the cross! O Lamb of God,
Bring its scenes before me;
Help me walk from day to day,
With its shadows o'er me.

  In the cross, in the cross,
  Be my glory ever;
  From the cross my ransomed soul
  Nothing then shall sever.

Near the cross I'll watch and wait,
Hoping, trusting ever,
Till I see my Savior's face,
Leave His presence never.

  In the cross, in the cross,
  Be my glory ever;
  From the cross my ransomed soul
  Nothing then shall sever.--------1060
Thou didst leave Thy throne and Thy kingly crown,
When Thou camest to earth for me;
But in Bethlehem's home was there found no room
For Thy holy nativity:

  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
  There is room in my heart for Thee;
  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
  There is room in my heart for Thee.

Heaven's arches rang when the angels sang,
Proclaiming Thy royal degree;
But of lowly birth cam'st Thou, Lord, on earth,
And in great humility:

  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
  There is room in my heart for Thee;
  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
  There is room in my heart for Thee.

The foxes found rest, and the birds had their nest
In the shade of the forest tree;
But Thy couch was the sod, O Thou Son of God,
In the deserts of Galilee:

  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
  There is room in my heart for Thee;
  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
  There is room in my heart for Thee.

Thou camest, O Lord, with the living Word
That should set Thy people free;
But with mocking scorn, and with crown of thorn,
They bore Thee to Calvary:

  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus!
  Thy cross is my only plea;
  Oh, come to my heart, Lord Jesus, come,
  Thy cross is my only plea.

When heaven's arches shall ring, and her choirs shall sing
At Thy coming to victory,
Let Thy voice call me up, saying, "Yet there is room,
There is room at My side for thee!"

  And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!
  When Thou comest and callest for me;
  And my heart shall rejoice, Lord Jesus!
  When Thou comest and callest for me.--------1061
Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,
Come into my heart, I pray;
My soul is so troubled and weary,
Come into my heart, today.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Come in today, come in to stay,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.

Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,
I need Thee through life's dreary way;
The burden of sin is so heavy,
Come into my heart to stay.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Come in today, come in to stay,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.

Come into my heart, O Lord Jesus,
Now cleanse and illumine my soul;
Fill me with Thy wonderful Spirit,
Come in and take full control.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Come in today, come in to stay,
  Come into my heart, Lord Jesus.--------1062
I am coming to the cross;
I am poor, and weak, and blind;
I am counting all but dross;
I shall full salvation find.

  I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
  Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
  Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
  Save me, Jesus, save me now.

Long my heart has sighed for Thee;
Long has evil dwelt within;
Jesus sweetly speaks to me,
"I will cleanse you from all sin."

  I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
  Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
  Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
  Save me, Jesus, save me now.

Here I give my all to Thee
Friends and time and earthly store,
Soul and body Thine to be
Wholly Thine forevermore.

  I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
  Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
  Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
  Save me, Jesus, save me now.

In the promises I trust;
Now I feel the blood applied;
I am prostrate in the dust;
I with Christ am crucified.

  I am trusting, Lord, in Thee,
  Blessed Lamb of Calvary;
  Humbly at Thy cross I bow,
  Save me, Jesus, save me now.--------1063
Jesus, I will trust Thee,
Trust Thee with my soul,
Guilty, lost and helpless,
Thou canst make me whole:
There is none in heaven
Or on earth like Thee:
Thou hast died for sinners,
Therefore, Lord, for me.

  Jesus, I will trust Thee,
  Trust Thee with my soul,
  Guilty, lost and helpless,
  Thou canst make me whole.

Jesus, I must trust Thee,
Pondering Thy ways;
Full of love and mercy
All Thine earthly days:
Sinners gathered round Thee,
Lepers sought Thy face:
None too vile or loathsome
For a Savior's grace.

  Jesus, I will trust Thee,
  Trust Thee with my soul,
  Guilty, lost and helpless,
  Thou canst make me whole.

Jesus, I can trust Thee,
Trust Thy written Word,
Though Thy voice of pity
I have never heard:
When Thy Spirit teacheth,
To my taste how sweet!
Only may I hearken,
Sitting at Thy feet.

  Jesus, I will trust Thee,
  Trust Thee with my soul,
  Guilty, lost and helpless,
  Thou canst make me whole.

Jesus, I do trust Thee,
Trust without a doubt;
Whosever cometh
Thou wilt not cast out:
Faithful is Thy promise,
Precious is Thy blood:
These my soul's salvation,
Thou my Savior God!

  Jesus, I will trust Thee,
  Trust Thee with my soul,
  Guilty, lost and helpless,
  Thou canst make me whole.--------1064
I love to tell the story
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love.
I love to tell the story,
Because I know 'tis true;
It satisfies my longings
As nothing else can do.

  I love to tell the story,
  'Twill be my theme in glory
  To tell the old, old story
  Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story;
More wonderful it seems
Than all the golden fancies
Of all my golden dreams,
I love to tell the story,
It did so much for me;
And that is just the reason
I tell it now to thee.

  I love to tell the story,
  'Twill be my theme in glory
  To tell the old, old story
  Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story;
'Tis pleasant to repeat
What seems each time I tell it,
More wonderfully sweet.
I love to tell the story;
For some have never heard
The message of salvation
From God's own holy Word.

  I love to tell the story,
  'Twill be my theme in glory
  To tell the old, old story
  Of Jesus and His love.

I love to tell the story;
For those who know it best
Seem hungering and thirsting
To hear it like the rest.
And when, in scenes of glory,
I sing the new, new song,
'Twill be the old, old story,
That I have loved so long.

  I love to tell the story,
  'Twill be my theme in glory
  To tell the old, old story
  Of Jesus and His love.--------1065
O how great His salvation!
O how great His salvation!
O how great His salvation!
Jesus saves me now!

  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus sets me free!

All my sins are forgiven!
All my fetters are riven!
I enjoy peace of heaven!
Jesus saves me now!

  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus sets me free!

Neither sin nor temptation,
Neither Satan's vexation,
Nor the world's best elation
Can enslave me now!

  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus sets me free!

I will sing Hallelujah!
I will sing Hallelujah!
I will sing Hallelujah!
Jesus saves me now!

  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus breaks every fetter!
  Jesus sets me free!--------1066
Down at the cross where my Savior died,
Down where for cleansing from sin I cried,
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His name.

Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin.
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name.

Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!

Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul at the Savior's feet;
Plunge in today, and be made complete;
Glory to His name.

Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!--------1067
There was One who was willing to die in my stead,
That a soul so unworthy might live,
And the path to the cross He was willing to tread,
All the sins of my life to forgive.

  They were borne on the cross,
  They were borne on the cross,
  O how much He was willing to bear!
  With what anguish and loss,
  Jesus went to the cross!
  But He carried my sins with Him there.

He is tender and loving and patient with me,
While He cleanses my heart of its dross;
But "there's no condemnation," I know I am free,
For my sins were all borne on the cross.

  They were borne on the cross,
  They were borne on the cross,
  O how much He was willing to bear!
  With what anguish and loss,
  Jesus went to the cross!
  But He carried my sins with Him there.

I will cling to my Savior and never depart
I will joyfully journey each day,
With a song on my lips and a song in my heart,
That my sins have been taken away.

  They were borne on the cross,
  They were borne on the cross,
  O how much He was willing to bear!
  With what anguish and loss,
  Jesus went to the cross!
  But He carried my sins with Him there.--------1068
In tenderness He sought me,
Weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me
Into His flock again.
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of heaven rang.

  Oh, the love that sought me!
  Oh, the blood that bought me!
  Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
  Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
"I've found thee, thou art Mine:"
I never heard a sweeter voice,
It made my aching heart rejoice.

  Oh, the love that sought me!
  Oh, the blood that bought me!
  Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
  Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

He pointed to the nail-prints,
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown so thorny,
Was placed upon His head:
I wondered what He saw in me,
To suffer such deep agony.

  Oh, the love that sought me!
  Oh, the blood that bought me!
  Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
  Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

I'm sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

  Oh, the love that sought me!
  Oh, the blood that bought me!
  Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
  Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I'm waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side,
To be with Him, His spotless Bride.

  Oh, the love that sought me!
  Oh, the blood that bought me!
  Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
  Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!--------1069
We're feeding on the living Bread,
We're drinking at the fountainhead;
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.

  What! never thirst again?
  No, never thirst again!
  What! never thirst again?
  No, never thirst again!
  And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
  Shall never, never thirst again!--------1070
  Repeat each chorus once

I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.

  Love lifted me!
  Love lifted me!
  When nothing else could help,
  Love lifted me.

All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I'll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul's best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

  Love lifted me!
  Love lifted me!
  When nothing else could help,
  Love lifted me.

Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves.
He's the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Savior wants to be
Be saved today.

  Love lifted me!
  Love lifted me!
  When nothing else could help,
  Love lifted me.--------1071
Sinner Jesus will receive;
Sound this word of grace to all
Who the heavenly pathway leave,
All who linger, all who fall.

  Sing it o'er and o'er again;
  Christ receiveth sinful men;
  Make the message clear and plain:
  Christ receiveth sinful men.

Come, and He will give you rest;
Trust Him for His word is plain;
He will take the sinfulest;
Christ receiveth sinful men.

  Sing it o'er and o'er again;
  Christ receiveth sinful men;
  Make the message clear and plain:
  Christ receiveth sinful men.

Now my heart condemns me not,
Pure before the law I stand;
He who cleansed me from all spot,
Satisfied its last demand.

  Sing it o'er and o'er again;
  Christ receiveth sinful men;
  Make the message clear and plain:
  Christ receiveth sinful men.

Christ receiveth sinful men,
Even me with all my sin;
Purged from every spot and stain,
Glory I shall enter in.

  Sing it o'er and o'er again;
  Christ receiveth sinful men;
  Make the message clear and plain:
  Christ receiveth sinful men.--------1072
She only touched the hem of His garment
As to His side she stole,
Amid the crowd that gathered around Him;
And straightway she was whole.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His saving power this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!

He's pow'rful, present, real and gracious;
Thou too canst touch Him now!
Just come and touch while He is still passing,
His power thou shalt know.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His saving power this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!

Just touch in faith and touch Him in spirit,
And He will make thee whole;
And peace that passeth all understanding
With joy will fill thy soul.

  Oh, touch the hem of His garment!
  And thou, too, shalt be free!
  His saving power this very hour
  Shall give new life to thee!--------1073
Hark, here is a hidden myst'ry,
Hidden from the human hist'ry!
Hark and take this glorious myst'ry,
Christ will be one with you!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Hark and take this glorious myst'ry,
Christ will be one with you!--------1074
O what a mystery, the Savior
With me is one!
O what a marvelous salvation
God gives me in His Son!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Glorious mystery!
Nothing in heav'n or earth can sever
Jesus my Lord from me!--------1075
Tell me the old, old story,
Of unseen things above,
Of Jesus and His glory,
Of Jesus and His love;
Tell me the story simply,
As to a little child,
For I am weak and weary,
And helpless and defiled.

  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story slowly,
That I may take it in
That wonderful redemption,
God's remedy for sin;
Tell me the story often,
For I forget so soon,
The "early dew" of morning
Has passed away at noon.

  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the story softly,
With earnest tones and grave;
Remember I'm the sinner
Whom Jesus came to save;
Tell me the story always,
If you would really be,
In any time of trouble,
A comforter to me.

  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Of Jesus and His love.

Tell me the same old story,
When you have cause to fear
That this world's empty glory
Is costing me too dear;
And when the Lord's bright glory
Is dawning on my soul,
Tell me the old, old story:
"Christ Jesus makes thee whole."

  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Tell me the old, old story,
  Of Jesus and His love.--------1076
O teach me what it meaneth:
That Cross uplifted high,
With One, the Man of Sorrows,
Condemned to bleed and die.
O teach me what it cost Thee
To make a sinner whole;
And teach me, Savior, teach me
The value of a soul.

O teach me what it meaneth:
That sacred crimson tide,
The blood and water flowing
From Thine own wounded side.
Teach me that if none other
*Had sinned but only I,
Yet still, O blessed Savior,
Thou on the cross must die.
*Last three lines of verse 2, originally:
Had sinned, but I alone,
Yet still, Thy blood, O Jesus,
Thine only, must atone.

O teach me what it meaneth:
Thy love beyond compare,
The love that reacheth deeper
Than depths of self-despair!
Yea, teach me, till there gloweth
In this cold heart of mine
Some feeble, pale reflection
Of that pure love of Thine.

O teach me what it meaneth,
For I am full of sin;
And grace alone can reach me,
And love alone can win.
O teach me, for I need Thee,
I have no hope beside,
The chief of all the sinners
For whom the Savior died.

O teach me what it meaneth:
The rest which Thou dost give
To all the heavy-laden
Who look to Thee and live.
Because I am a rebel
Thy pardon I receive:
Because Thou dost command me,
I can, I do believe.

O infinite Redeemer,
I bring no other plea;
Because Thou dost invite me
I cast myself on Thee.
Because Thou dost accept me
I love and I adore;
Because Thy love constraineth,
I'll praise Thee evermore.--------1077
  Repeat the last line of each verse

There were ninety and nine that safely lay
In the shelter of the flock,
But one was on the hills away,
Far off in the cold and dark;
Away on the mountains wild and bare,
Away from the tender Shepherd's care.

"Lord, Thou hast here Thy ninety and nine;
Are they not enough for Thee?"
But the Shepherd made answer: "This of Mine
Has wandered away from Me;
And although the road be rough and steep,
I go to the desert to find My sheep."

But none of the ransomed ever knew
How deep were the waters crossed;
Nor how dark was the night which the Lord passed though
Ere He found His sheep that was lost.
Out in the bleak desert He heard its cry
All bleeding and helpless, and ready to die.

"Lord, whence are those blood-drops all the way
That mark out the mountain's track?"
"They were shed for one who had gone astray
Ere the Shepherd could bring him back."
"Lord, whence are Thy hands so rent and torn?"
"They're pierced tonight by many a thorn."

And all through the mountains, thunder-riven,
And up from the rocky steep,
There arose a cry to the gate of heaven,
"Rejoice! I have found My sheep!"
And the angels echoed around the throne,
"Rejoice, for the Lord brings back His own!"--------1078
One sat alone beside the highway begging,
His eyes were blind, the light he could not see;
He clutched his rags and shivered in the shadows,
Then Jesus came and bade his darkness flee.

  When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
  When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
  He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
  For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

From home and friends the evil spirits drove him,
Among the tombs he dwelt in misery;
He cut himself as demon pow'rs possessed him,
Then Jesus came and set the captive free.

  When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
  When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
  He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
  For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

"Unclean! Unclean!" the leper cried in torment,
The deaf, the dumb, in helplessness stood near;
The fever raged, disease had gripped its victim,
Then Jesus came and cast out every fear.

  When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
  When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
  He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
  For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

Their hearts were sad as in the tomb they laid him,
For death had come and taken him away;
Their night was dark and bitter tears were falling,
Then Jesus came and night was turned to day.

  When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
  When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
  He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
  For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.

So men today have found the Savior able,
They could not conquer passion, lust and sin;
Their broken hearts had left them sad and lonely,
Then Jesus came and dwelt, Himself, within.

  When Jesus comes the tempter's pow'r is broken;
  When Jesus comes the tears are wiped away.
  He takes the gloom and fills the life with glory,
  For all is changed when Jesus comes to stay.--------1079
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Were my life worth living for a day?
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
In the things that soon must pass away?
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
And a name revered both far and near,
Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,
Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Who endured the cross and died for me,
Could then all the world afford a refuge,
Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

O what emptiness!  without the Savior
'Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
And eternity, how dark without Him!
Only night and tears and endless woe!
What, though I might live without the Savior,
When I come to die, how would it be?
O to face the valley's gloom without Him!
And without Him all eternity!

O the joy of having all in Jesus!
What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne'er a sin so great, but He'll forgive it,
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
Nothing else in all the world beside
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
For my needs and more He will provide.--------1080
What profit all the labor here?
There's nothing new for you and me!
Remember not the former things,
They're all vanity!

  Vanity! Vanity!
  Vanity! Vanity!
  'Tis chasing the wind,
  It's all vanity!

Man's life is full of grief and pain:
Much wisdom bringeth misery!
Increasing knowledge addeth woe!
It's all vanity!

  Vanity! Vanity!
  Vanity! Vanity!
  'Tis chasing the wind,
  It's all vanity!

What good our pleasure and our wealth?
Though joys we have and family,
We'll have our worries just the same!
It's all vanity!

  Vanity! Vanity!
  Vanity! Vanity!
  'Tis chasing the wind,
  It's all vanity!

Days of toil to gain and restless nights:
Though gained without calamity,
When death comes it is gone for aye!
It's all vanity!

  Vanity! Vanity!
  Vanity! Vanity!
  'Tis chasing the wind,
  It's all vanity!

Remember God in days of youth!
Fear Him, and such will be your gain!
With Him you will be satisfied,
For He is not vain!

  Christ without, all is vain!
  Christ within, all is gain!
  All things are vain,
  Christ only is gain!--------1081
John 17

Father God, Thou art the source of life.
We, Thy sons, are Thine expression;
In Thy name, our dear possession.
Father God, Thou art the source of life.

  In Thy life, in Thy life,
  We have oneness in Thy life.
  In Thy life, in Thy life,
  In Thy life, O Father, we are one.

How we thank Thee that Thy holy Word
With Thy nature, saturates us;
From the world it separates us.
Thank Thee, Father, for Thy holy Word.

  Through Thy Word, through Thy Word,
  We have oneness through Thy Word.
  Through Thy Word, through Thy Word,
  Through Thy holy Word we're all made one.

Oh, the glory of the Triune God!
We're His sons, oh, what a blessing!
We His glory are expressing
Oh, the glory of the Triune God!

  In Thy glory, in Thy glory,
  In Thy glory we are one.
  In Thy glory, in Thy glory,
  In Thy glory we are all made one!--------1082
Psalm 16

The living of Christ when He sojourned on earth,
The sixteenth Psalm shows us, was wholly of worth.
His attitudes, choices, and interests all tell
The man who in God's tabernacle may dwell.

"Preserve me, O God, for in Thee I confide"
In God He took refuge whate'er did betide.
"O Thou art my Lord, I've no good beyond Thee"
He spoke in Himself unto God constantly.

"As for all the saints who are dwelling on earth,"
To Him they're the people of excellent worth.
Of them He has said He has all His delight
In proving this all the four Gospels unite.

"The Lord is my portion, the Lord is my cup"
For everything He to the Father looked up.
"The Lord I will bless who my counsel doth give"
Himself He denied and by God's word did live.

His heart thus was glad and His spirit rejoiced,
And e'en in His death praise to God could be voiced;
His soul God would never abandon to hell,
But in resurrection His body would dwell.

God raised Him, and He with God's glory was crowned;
Then fulness of joy in God's presence He found.
E'en now at the Father's right hand is His seat,
Where flowing forever are pleasures complete.--------1083
O how nigh the Lord is unto all who call on Him!
When we call, His very presence strengthens us within.
Seeking Jesus, He is found, and calling, He is near
O what a comfort to our hearts to call His name so dear!

  Jesus! O what a name!
  O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
  Name victorious, name all-glorious,
  Name exalted  O what a name!
  Jesus! Strengthening name!
  O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
  Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
  "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!

Call upon the name of Jesus, and you will be saved,
O Lord Jesus, hallelujah, nevermore enslaved!
We may take salvation's cup by calling on the Lord;
Salvation from a host of things does His dear name afford.

  Jesus! O what a name!
  O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
  Name victorious, name all-glorious,
  Name exalted  O what a name!
  Jesus! Strengthening name!
  O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
  Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
  "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!

To the Lord, the Jew, the Greek and everyone's the same;
He is rich unto all men that call upon His name.
O Lord Jesus, what a joy to call and really live;
When breathing in Thy name, what pleasure Thou to us dost give.

  Jesus! O what a name!
  O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
  Name victorious, name all-glorious,
  Name exalted  O what a name!
  Jesus! Strengthening name!
  O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
  Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
  "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!

In the God of our salvation we may take delight,
Calling on His name at all times, though in bliss or blight.
I will call upon His name as long as I shall live,
Because He has inclined His ear, and grace so full does give.

  Jesus! O what a name!
  O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
  Name victorious, name all-glorious,
  Name exalted  O what a name!
  Jesus! Strengthening name!
  O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
  Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
  "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!

We will call upon the Lord, who's worthy of our praise;
Thus our grateful hearts in worship we to Him may raise.
We are those who call upon His name in every place
With all the saints who from a pure heart call and taste His grace.

  Jesus! O what a name!
  O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
  Name victorious, name all-glorious,
  Name exalted  O what a name!
  Jesus! Strengthening name!
  O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
  Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
  "O Lord Jesus!" O what a name!--------1084
Thy name is as ointment poured forth:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Thy name is as ointment poured forth,
Thy name is as ointment poured forth.

Therefore do the virgins love Thee:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Therefore do the virgins love Thee,
Therefore do the virgins love Thee.

Thy love is much better than wine:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Thy love is much better than wine,
Thy love is much better than wine.

Draw me, we will run after Thee:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Draw me, we will run after Thee,
Draw me, we will run after Thee.

Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved,
Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved.

I found Him whom my soul doth love:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
I found Him whom my soul doth love,
I found Him whom my soul doth love.

I held Him and would not let go:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
I held Him and would not let go,
I held Him and would not let go.

Make haste, my Beloved, to come:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Make haste, my Beloved, to come,
Make haste, my Beloved, to come.

We love Thee with all of our heart:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
We love Thee with all of our heart,
We love Thee with all of our heart.--------1085
His Name is Wonderful;
His Name is Counselor;
His name the Mighty God,
Jesus my Lord.
A Child and Son is He;
Eternal Father He;
The Prince of Peace to me,
Jesus my Lord.
Praise the Creator,
Jesus our Savior,
Life-giving Spirit now.
In spirit worship Him.
Love and adore Him;
His Name is Wonderful,
Jesus my Lord.--------1086
How we love the glorious name,
The name of Jesus!
'Tis the name above all names
On earth or in heav'n.
As we breathe this precious name,
Darkness and death cannot remain;
For we call and get the Person of that name!

Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues
We gladly confess Thy name,
To the glory of the Father God above.
For to us to speak Thy praise,
Is the enjoyment of our days;
Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!--------1087
Oh, hallelujah, what a death
Christ died upon the cross!
Not only was He dying there
But everything that death did share:
God was included too,
All men with me and you
Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!

Oh, praise the Lord, man died in God
And to an end was brought!
Now from this man I'm wholly free
For God has terminated me!
Oh, what a wondrous death,
Oh, what a wondrous death;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a death!

Oh, praise the Lord, God died in man,
In man to be released.
The grain of wheat fell to the ground,
And now a multitude is found
Filled with the life of God,
Filled with the life of God;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a life!

Lord, how we praise You for Your cross,
Your all-inclusive death!
The center of the universe,
It has untold, eternal worth!
Lord, how we love Your cross,
Lord, how we love Your cross;
Oh, hallelujah, for such a cross!--------1088
God was born a human being
As the Babe of Bethlehem,
Passed He then through human living,
Perfect blend of God with men.
God, according to His plan,
Lived a mingled life with man.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Then with God this man was blended
On the altar as He died;
God and man and all creation
On the cross were crucified.
Man and all of God's creation,
Sunk in total termination.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Everything we are was ended,
Terminated on the cross,
Only man in God ascended,
Man in Adam suffered loss.
Hallelujah, we're elated,
Our old man was terminated.
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Like the grain of wheat that's buried
In the earth to be increased,
God's own life the death must suffer,
Thus in man to be released.
Oh, the Lord of all be praised;
God released in man is raised!
Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!--------1089
John 1:29; 3:14; 12:24

Lamb of God so pure and spotless,
Lamb of God for sinners slain.
Thy shed blood has wrought redemption.
Cleansing us from every stain.
Lamb redeeming, Lamb redeeming.
Bearing all our sins away,
Bearing all our sins away!

Brazen serpent, to Thee looking,
Son of Man, uplifted high.
Thou didst bear the flesh of sin in
Likeness on the cross to die.
Old creation's termination;
Finished, Satan and the world,
Finished, Satan and the world!

Grain of wheat, so small and lowly,
Without death abides alone;
Life divine enclosed within it,
Into death it must be sown.
Life releasing, Christ increasing,
Many grains to birth to bring,
Many grains to birth to bring!

Lamb of God  our sin's redemption,
Brazen serpent  Satan's end,
Grain of wheat  life's reproduction,
Now with many grains we blend.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
What an all-inclusive death,
What an all-inclusive death!--------1090
Dear Lord, how precious is Thy blood,
Of the New Testament!
By it God's blessings we receive,
And we with Him are blent.

'Tis by Thy blood we've been redeemed,
And by it sanctified.
Now is our conscience free from sin,
From dead works purified.

Better than Abel's, now Thy blood
Speaks unto God for us.
Perfect redemption it provides,
Meeting God's righteousness.

Through the eternal Spirit, Thou
Offeredst Thyself to God.
This sacrifice can ne'er grow old;
Timeless is Thy dear blood.

'Tis by Thy blood we boldly come
Unto the throne of grace,
Unto our God, the cov'nant new,
And to the Holiest Place.

Lord, by Thy blood, God is obliged
His very Self to give;
He must receive us to Himself,
And He in us must live.

Dear Lord, how precious is Thy blood
Of the New Testament!
By it God's blessings we receive,
And we with Him are blent.--------1091
We praise Thee, O Lord Jesus, Thou didst come,
The way into God's presence to reveal.
We worship Thee that Thou didst leave Thy throne,
To come as our High Priest with sin to deal.
Lord Jesus, Thou hast offered Thine own blood,
And settled once for all our peace with God.

Thy blood has now been sprinkled on the throne
In full redemption for Thy people's sin.
The sweetness of the love that Thou hast shown
Has ris'n to fill the holiest place within.
And by the blood once offered in that place
God flows to us in mercy and in grace.

Yet, Lord, Thou camest not just to atone,
But Thou didst come and bear our sins away.
We, with a conscience purged, approach the throne,
For all our sins were laid on Thee that day.
Thou, separated from the Father's face,
Didst pay the awful price for us in grace.

The way into God's presence thus is cleared,
For ransomed sinners who have heard Thy call.
Thou, Lord, hast taken all that we had feared
When Thou didst shed Thy blood and give Thine all;
Our heart in grateful praise to Thee we bind,
And now our life in Thee alone we find.--------1092
Revelation 5

The saints throughout the centuries
Have praised the Lord that He,
The Lamb of God, has saved us,
From sin has set us free;
Yet scarcely for the Lion
Have we yet sounded praise,
Though oft for our redemption
We've all our voices raised.

John wept as he considered
That none the right did own
The scroll to take and open,
God's myst'ry to make known;
No, none on earth nor heaven,
Nor universe around
And we, too, would be weeping
If none were worthy found.

The universe, mysterious,
Would be in darkness still,
Could none break through to open
The scroll, to show God's will;
But, lo, the worthy Lion
Of Judah hath prevailed
The seven seals to open,
And have the scroll unveiled.

No longer now in darkness
God's secret is enclosed,
But to our inner vision
It's open, full, disclosed;
Our hearts are for this purpose,
Our lives are for His plan;
And for this revelation
We praise the Lion-Lamb!

The four-and-twenty elders
All fall before that sight.
The living creatures praise Him,
Who rest not, day nor night.
So let us join their praises
To Him who loosed God's plan;
We'll lift with theirs our voices
To praise the Lion-Lamb!--------1093
Revelation 5

Through countless ages, many men
Have longed and sought and tried to see
The secret of the universe,
So vast, so great a mystery.

Yet not through struggling could frail man
The secret of this myst'ry find;
Nor change, by stumbling, come upon
Such hidden things  to these he's blind.

Behold in heav'n a throne is set,
And One upon the throne revealed;
And held in His right hand a scroll
The mystery is tightly sealed.

Through all the universe, a cry
'Can one be found of such great worth
The scroll to take? ... yet no reply,
From heav'n, below, or on the earth.

Were it a matter now for man
By chance, or some ability,
Then surely one would now step forth
To open God's economy.

Yet sad and solemn was that sight.
John wept as then he looked around;
And we, too, still might weeping be
If none at all were worthy found.

But then the angel said, 'Weep not!
Behold, the Lion has prevailed
To take the scroll and loose its seals;
He has the mystery now unveiled!'

So, John looked up the Lion to see,
But, lo, he then beheld a Lamb;
Christ both o'ercame the enemy,
And wrought redemption's work for man.

The angels fall before His throne,
Four living creatures offer praise,
All glory to the Lion-Lamb;
Let us with theirs our voices raise!--------1094
Psalm 2

Lo, the nations all assemble
And imagine vanity,
Kings and princes plot together
'Gainst the Lord in unity.
"Let us break their bonds asunder,
Cast away their cords from us."
'Gainst the Lord and His Anointed
Worldly rulers counsel thus.

He who sitteth in the heavens
In contempt will laugh at them,
Vex them in His fierce displeasure,
Terrifying all such men.
Yet upon the hill of Zion
God has His anointed King
This is God's own declaration,
All the kings admonishing.

Now 'tis Christ, 'tis God's Anointed,
Who declares the Lord's decree:
"Thou'rt my Son (in resurrection),
This day I've begotten Thee.
For Thine own inheritance.
Thou shalt dash them into pieces
In Thy kingly excellence."

Now be wise, O be instructed,
All ye rulers of the earth,
Fear the Lord, rejoice with trembling,
Serve the only One of worth.
Kiss the Son, lest He be angry
And ye perish in the way.
"All who trust in Him are blessed,"
All who trust in Him will say.

Lord, we praise Thee, we have seen Him
Thy unique Anointed One
And from vanity repenting,
We in love have kissed Thy Son.
"All who trust in Him are blessed"
Not "all those who keep the law."
In that risen One believing,
We are blest forevermore.--------1095
The Lord shall get the glory
If we will sing His praise,
And angel hosts will listen
When we our voices raise;
The world around will hear us
Give glory unto God,
And Satan's hosts will tremble
And flee our conqu'ring rod.

Our mouth shut up defeats us
And wins the Devil's smile;
So why not open battle
And chase him all the while.
By "sacrifice of praises"
And shouts of victory
'Twill cost us but our faces
God's chosen fools to be!

The world has never helped us
To shout our Savior's praise,
Nor given Him the glory
Nor lent one thankful phrase;
So need we ask permission
To praise th' ascended Lord?
Cry out! Release your spirit!
Much grace He does afford!

O brothers, be not silent!
O sisters, cry aloud!
The sound shall tell God's triumph
And blessings far abroad.
Now is the time to praise Him,
Yes now, at any cost!
O joy in your salvation,
And in His mercy boast!--------1096
'Tis the local church proclaiming,
Jesus is Lord!
All the saints with joy are naming
Jesus as Lord.
All His work He has completed,
Satan and his hosts defeated;
On the throne of glory seated,
Jesus is Lord!

Jesus is the living Spirit,
Jesus is Lord!
He is here, all people, hear it:
Jesus is Lord!
Be no more a poor lamenter;
Call on Him, and He will enter
And become your glorious center
Jesus is Lord!

He will transform all your living,
Jesus, the Lord!
All His riches to you giving,
Jesus, the Lord!
He'll forever satisfy you,
Everyday real life supply you,
And with God will unify you,
Jesus the Lord!

In His mercy He received us,
Jesus, the Lord!
He will never, never leave us,
Jesus, the Lord!
All the fullness of His being
In His Body we are seeing,
And the enemy is fleeing
Jesus is Lord!--------1097
Psalm 8

O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
Thy name in all the earth!
Let every people, tribe, and tongue
Proclaim its boundless worth.
Out of the mouth of little ones
Thou hast established praise,
That Thou may still Thine enemy
And swiftly end his days.

When we the universe behold,
The work of Thy great hand
The sun, the moon, and all the stars
By lofty wisdom planned;
O what is man that Thou should'st care
That Thou should'st mindful be?
The son of man Thou visitest
In Thine economy.

O Jesus Lord, Thou art that man,
The One who joined our race,
Who put upon Himself the flesh
And took a lower place.
But now with glory Thou art crowned,
With sovereignty complete.
Now through Thy Body Thou dost rule
With all beneath Thy feet.

Thine incarnation, rising too,
And Thy transcendency,
Thy Lordship, Headship, kingdom full,
And Body here we see.
By all these steps of work divine
Thou hast established praise.
With overflowing hearts to Thee
Our joyful voice we raise.

Oh, soon that blessed day shall come
All tongues these words shall peal!
But in the local churches now
We have a foretaste real.
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent
Thy name in all the earth!
Let every people, tribe, and tongue
Proclaim its boundless worth.--------1098
Psalm 45 - Part 1

Our hearts are overflowing
To speak a goodly thing
To tell what we've experienced
Of our exalted King.
Our tongues as pens are ready,
We've volumes here to "write"
The glories of our Bridegroom,
Our Lord and our delight.

Lord Jesus, Thou art fairer
Than all the sons of men;
Thy goodness is transcendent
Hallelujah! Amen!
Upon Thy lips most holy
Abundant grace is poured;
Forever God has blessed Thee,
Our gracious, glorious Lord!

Thou art the mighty Warrior
Who rides to victory;
In Thy majestic glory
Ride on triumphantly!
The peoples fall beneath Thee
The conquering One Thou art.
Thine arrows in their sharpness
Have entered Satan's heart!

Thy throne, O God, forever
And ever shall endure;
The sceptre of Thy kingdom
Upon the earth is sure.
'Tis with the oil of gladness
God has anointed Thee
Above all Thy companions
How worthy there to be!

Of aloes, myrrh, and cassia
Do all Thy garments smell:
Thy death and resurrection
Do all Thy deeds forthtell.
Out of the local churches
Shall praises make Thee glad,
And praises upon praises
Thy joyful saints shall add.--------1099
Psalm 45 - Part 2

The queen in gold of Ophir
At Thy right hand doth stand;
King's daughters are the women
Who fill Thy honored band.
The church in all her glory
Shall match her glorious King,
And all the saints, the women,
Thy likeness there shall bring.

O daughter, now consider,
E'en now incline thine ear:
Remember not thy people
And all thine own things here.
Thy beauty then shall blossom
'Twill be the King's desire;
For He thy worthy Lord is,
Thy worship to inspire.

The daughter's glorious garments
Are made of inwrought gold
Within the inner palace,
How wondrous to behold!
The glory of God's nature
Is given her to wear,
That all His holy being
She may in life declare.

In clothing too embroidered
She'll to the King be led,
In that fine linen garment
To be exhibited.
'Tis by the Spirit's stitching
That Christ in us is wrought,
And with this glorious garment
We'll to the King be brought.

What gladness and rejoicing
When we the King shall see!
We'll shout His worthy praises
Through all eternity.
And though the King we worship
Or glory in the Queen,
In all this blest enjoyment
The glory goes to Him.--------1100
Psalm 68

God shall rise, His foes be scattered,
All that hate Him flee away.
As the wax before the fire,
All the wicked He shall slay.
But the righteous shall rejoice
With a loud, triumphant voice,
Singing praises, singing praises,
Singing praises unto God!

He is riding through the deserts,
Bringing in His saints in need.
He's a Father to the orphans
And a refuge tried indeed
In His holy habitation
What a wonderful salvation!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Here the lone have found a family,
Here the desolate a home;
Prisoners are brought from bondage
To prosperity unknown.
For the flock  what wondrous grace
God prepared this dwelling place:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Now the Lord in mighty triumph
Sends the news of victory;
We the "women" spread the tidings
"Kings of armies flee, they flee!"
No more sweat and dreary toil;
We at home divide the spoil!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Lo, on high Christ hath ascended,
Leading captives in His train;
These as gifts He has perfected
That the Lord may dwell with them.
Brothers, sisters, we are those,
We're those transformed, vanquished foes!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

Blessed be the Lord forever:
Day by day He loads with good,
E'en the God of our salvation
Spread His worthy praise abroad.
His the goings forth from death,
Every foe He conquereth!
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah, Amen!

They have seen, O God, Thy goings
In Thy holy dwelling place,
Thy triumphal, high processions
Midst a mighty voice of praise.
See the singers go before,
Praising, praising o'er and o'er:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah! Amen!

Little Benjamin is leading,
Then great Judah's company:
Son of sorrow at God's right hand,
Lion with the scepter see.
Zebulun and Naphtali
Make the joyful tidings fly:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah! Amen!

Saints, thy strength has been commanded
From the temple glorious;
Still we pray that God may strengthen
All that He has wrought for us.
Higher yet our praise shall rise
Till the utmost earth replies:
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah! Amen!--------1101
Revelation 12, 18-21

Lo, the kingdom of the world is now the kingdom of the Lord!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

By our word of testimony, all declaring, "It is done!"
Unto death, our souls not loving  all the glory to the Son!
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

Oh, but brothers, sisters, listen to another mighty voice,
"Babylon is fallen, fallen"  what a reason to rejoice!
O how blest that coming out from her was our eternal choice
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

She's the mother of the harlots, Myst'ry, Babylon the Great!
O how all her evil fornication we have learned to hate!
But our God has doubly judged her  this our spirits doth elate.
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

Hallelujah! Glory, power to the Lord our God belong!
True and righteous are His judgments on the harlot for her wrong!
See, her smoke is rising! Echo hallelujah in your song
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

"Praise our God now, all ye servants, small and great," His voice constrains.
As the sound of many waters, we will thunder our refrains:
Hallelujah, hallelujah, for the Lord Almighty reigns!
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  The victory is won!

Now rejoice and be exceeding glad! What glory is displayed!
For the marriage of the Lamb, the wife all ready now is made!
In fine linen, bright and pure, 'twas granted her to be arrayed
The victory is won!

  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!
  Vict'ry, vict'ry, Hallelujah!

In His holiness and glory He's expressed through all of them.
"It is done!" O brothers, see it! See the New Jerusalem!
The victory is won!

  Hallelujah, hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, hallelujah!
  The victory is won!--------1102
Psalm 110

The Lord said unto my Lord,
"Sit Thou at My right hand;
Thy foes shall be Thy footstool,
Upon them Thou shalt stand."
The sceptre of Thy strength shall
The Lord from Zion send
To rule o'er all the nations
Forever 'til the end.

A voluntary offering,
The young ones are to Thee;
In consecration's splendor
How beautiful to see!
For as the dew of morning
Refreshes all the land
The young ones given to Thee
Are precious in Thy hand.

The Lord hath sworn forever
And never will turn back,
"Thou art a priest forever,
As was Melchizedek."
Oh, Thou hast no beginning
Of days; of life: no end!
And on Thine intercession
We ever do depend.

The Lord is at Thy right hand
And in His day of wrath
He'll strike through rulers, judging
The nations in His path.
While riding on to triumph
He'll drink of us, the stream,
His head uplifted, strengthened,
The whole earth to redeem.

Oh Lord, Thou art ascended
To God's right hand to sit;
As Head o'er all things, to Thee
God doth Thy foes commit.
Our King  for us Thou reignest,
Our Priest  we are supplied,
Our all we give unto Thee,
Thou Conqueror glorified.--------1103

Leviticus 3; 7:11-38

Lord, Thou art our peace offering;
We lay our hands on Thee.
We're one with Thee, Lord Jesus,
In fact and practically.
Here in the tent of meeting
We offer Thee to God
And with the Father feasting
Enjoy Thee as our food.

  Christ is our peace! Christ is our peace!
  We praise Thee, blessed Lord!
  Our peace with God, our peace with man
  Have fully been restored.

O what a peace it gives us
To see the sprinkled blood.
The blood of our peace offering
Has brought us peace with God.
With boldness we're proclaiming
Now hear this, enemy
"Peace by the blood of Jesus!"
This is our victory.

  Christ is our peace! Christ is our peace!
  We praise Thee, blessed Lord!
  Our peace with God, our peace with man
  Have fully been restored.

Based on the burnt oblation
And the meal offering too,
We now may offer Jesus
As our peace offering true.
The more we eat and drink Him
In His humanity,
The more we may enjoy Him
While feasting corporately.

  What fellowship, what fellowship
  With God and man we share!
  O what a joy, O what a feast
  With all God's people here.

Here God enjoys His portion
'Tis inward, hidden, sweet
And all the priestly family
May here the wave breast eat.
The offering priest  how precious
May of the best partake:
He gets the right heave shoulder
And one unleavened cake.

  What fellowship, what fellowship
  With God and man we share!
  O what a joy, O what a feast
  With all God's people here.

How sweet to eat the wave breast,
The all-embracing love
Of Christ in resurrection!
It sets us all above.
What strength to eat the shoulder
Of the ascended One
And with the cake be nourished
To walk as He has done.

  What fellowship, what fellowship
  With God and man we share!
  O what a joy, O what a feast
  With all God's people here.

With all the cleansed ones feasting,
How rich the Christ we eat!
Oh, this is true communion,
The only way to meet.
We bring our full thanksgiving
And e'en would make a vow
We're for the Lord's recovery
As He is for us now.

  What fellowship, what fellowship
  With God and man we share!
  O what a joy, O what a feast
  With all God's people here.--------1105
Lo, the table spread before us
With the bread and with the wine:
Lo, the Savior waiting for us,
Bidding us to come and dine.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Sup with Me and I with thee";
He's prepared for us this table
Let us feast abundantly.

We are feasting with our Savior,
He with us and we with Him;
Hallelujah, hallelujah!
Feast of feasts that ne'er will end!
Eating, drinking with Thyself, Lord,
We are wholly satisfied.
Taste we of that glorious banquet
Thou wilt share with us, Thy Bride.--------1106
We gather together to eat the Lord's supper:
By eating and drinking, our oneness we show.
His presence possessing, our oneness confessing,
'Tis thus we eat and drink, and His blessing we know.

We're eating the bread of His body once broken
As now we're enjoying His Body made one:
One loaf on the table  one Body, we're able
To testify to all that the Lord's made us one.

We also are drinking the cup of His blessing,
The church's true fellowship of the Lord's blood;
Redeemed by believing, all saints we're receiving,
All those who through redemption have come unto God.

Oh, what can we say now except "Hallelujah!"
For such a reality given to us.
Thy blood we're employing, Thy Body enjoying;
Thus Thou wilt have the church for Thyself glorious.--------1107
We're gathered here, O Lord, as Thy one Body:
Though we be many, yet we all are one.
We share Thy life and own that we are members,
And thus within, in life we all are one.

  There is one Body in this universe,
  And we express it here on earth;
  We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.

There is one loaf, the symbol of Thy body:
'Twas broken so that all the saints may share.
We eat this bread and, as we are partaking,
Our actual oneness with all saints declare.

  There is one Body in this universe,
  And we express it here on earth;
  We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.

One bread, one cup are now upon the table,
Showing that we can be naught else but one.
Christ has redeemed us, made us His own Body:
What can we say but, "Amen, Lord, we're one!"

  There is one Body in this universe,
  And we express it here on earth;
  We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.

We stand as one, and cannot be divided,
Because our oneness is of Christ alone.
We eat as one: one loaf, one cup partaking,
And thus our oneness visibly is shown.

  There is one Body in this universe,
  And we express it here on earth;
  We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.

Oh, what a joy to have this blessed oneness!
We sense that Thou, O Lord, art satisfied;
And we too share this blissful satisfaction
Sweet foretaste of the Bridegroom with His Bride.

  There is one Body in this universe,
  And we express it here on earth;
  We stand as one in each locality
  For all to see, for all to see.--------1108
Eat the bread, ye people of the Lord:
Praise His name, for He has made us one.
Now we come to eat in one accord
As the church which He has made His own.

  Eat the bread and drink the wine, ye saints!
  We are one in Him fore'er.
  Stand in oneness on the local ground,
  Eat and drink in oneness there!

Drink the wine, ye people of the Lord:
We're the church His precious blood has bought.
We're redeemed to be in one accord
This the goal for which He long has sought.

  Eat the bread and drink the wine, ye saints!
  We are one in Him fore'er.
  Stand in oneness on the local ground,
  Eat and drink in oneness there!

Stand as one, ye people of the Lord:
Not as individual grains are we
We are one, we're blent in one accord
As a loaf in each locality.

  Eat the bread and drink the wine, ye saints!
  We are one in Him fore'er.
  Stand in oneness on the local ground,
  Eat and drink in oneness there!

We are one as people of the Lord;
We declare that we are really one!
Not just word, but life in one accord
Testify what God in us hath done.

  Eat the bread and drink the wine, ye saints!
  We are one in Him fore'er.
  Stand in oneness on the local ground,
  Eat and drink in oneness there!

Eat the bread, ye people of the Lord:
Praise His name, for He has made us one.
Now we come to eat in one accord
As the church which He has made His own.

  Do not repeat chorus after last verse--------1109
Take, drink this cup, His blood,
Redemption of our God.
The peace which Christ has made,
Is in this cup displayed.
We fellowship now with the Son:
On Calvary the work was done:
The way is clear, now all can come!

Take, drink this cup, each one,
His death show till He come.
Eat, drink, display this feast:
God in the Lamb released!
Around the table, sup and dine;
We eat the bread and drink the wine.
All blessing in this cup we find.

No blood of cow or goat
Could give us any hope.
Our sins would all remain
Still year by year the same.
A God-man, sinless, He must find
No other offering of His kind,
A spotless lamb for all mankind.

Come! Now enjoy His blood.
What access this to God!
Here wondrous cleansing power
Flows to us, hour by hour.
One sacrifice for all was made,
And peace our conscience does pervade.
Redemption's price is fully paid!

Redeemer! Savior! King!
Of Thy dear blood we sing,
For in it now we see
Thy mercy, boundless, free.
This cup, our portion blessed of God,
Is of the cov'nant in Thy blood
Dear, precious, precious, priceless blood!--------1110
O Jesus Lord, when present at Thy table,
And on the bread and on the wine we gaze;
We praise Thee, Lord, that Thou as food art able
To be enjoyed by man in many ways.

  So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
  And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

O what a shame  when Christ with all His riches,
Has come into the world, life to supply
That man would live, not by Him, but by teachings,
So powerless these riches to apply.

  But all we need to do is eat the Lord;
  He's marvelous, He's wonderful!
  And as we eat, we're inwardly restored;
  Christ grows in us, grows to the full.

O Jesus Christ, Thou camest not to mankind
To be a king, to rule us outwardly.
But Thou hast come as food to satisfy us,
And by Thy life to guide us inwardly.

  So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
  And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!

We praise Thee, Lord, for all Thy glorious grandeur,
For all Thy strength and majesty replete;
And yet, O Lord, what special thanks we give Thee,
That all Thou art is small enough to eat.

  So all our being sings in praise to Thee,
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!
  And Thee we'll eat through all eternity;
  How small Thou art, how small Thou art!--------1111
Genesis 14:17-20

Gathered at Thy table, Lord;
Here the bread and wine are spread.
Thou, our High Priest, present here;
We, by Thee, are richly fed.
Thou, Lord, our Melchisedec
We, the ones You come to feed;
God to us to minister,
Rich supply to us indeed.

From the slaughter of the kings
Abram did return one night,
O'er the foe victorious,
With the spoils of the fight.
On the way this One he met,
Who for him did intercede;
King of Righteousness and Peace
Meeting Abram in his need.

We too, Lord, the kings have fought
In the battle all day long;
By Thine intercession, Lord,
We are now victorious, strong.
Round this table here we meet,
We Thy church victorious,
To enjoy the ministering
Of the processed God to us.

We're not sinners, miserable;
All our sins are history!
Now to us, the fighters true,
Is Thy priestly ministry.
Gathered in thanksgiving, Lord,
Now our hearts to Thee we raise;
To our great Melchisedec,
Render we our highest praise!--------1112
Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord,
Thou, the man, our Host, presiding,
In Thy house, Thy home, abiding;
Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

How enjoyable Thy table, Lord,
As we fellowship around it,
Hallelujah, we have found it,
How enjoyable Thy table, Lord!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

Oh, how precious is Thy table, Lord
Bread and wine Thy death announcing;
Here our soul-life we're renouncing,
By partaking of Thy table, Lord.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

How significant Thy table, Lord
We Thy Body in the loaf seen,
Object of Thy love bespeaking;
How significant Thy table, Lord!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

How refreshing is Thy table, Lord
So completely satisfying,
Day by day our need supplying;
How refreshing is Thy table, Lord.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!

How encouraging Thy table, Lord
"Till He come," its promise giving
Hope, to fill our daily living;
How encouraging Thy table, Lord!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for this feast!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Oh, how glorious is Thy table, Lord!--------1113
Now the Triune God has come to dwell within
As the wonderful Spirit in us.
We are mingled with the Lord, we're one with Him
As the life-giving Spirit in us.

  Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
  God, is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!

"Abba Father" is the cry from deep within
From the wonderful Spirit in us.
'Tis the Spirit of the Son who cries to Him
As the life-giving Spirit in us.

  Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
  God, is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!

Jesus Christ the Lord is living now in us
As the wonderful Spirit within.
He has been transfigured, we enjoy Him thus,
As the life-giving Spirit within.

  Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
  God, is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!

Now the Spirit of reality is here
As the wonderful Spirit within.
Now the things of Christ are all so real and clear
By the life-giving Spirit within.

  Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
  God, is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!

We will all stir up this gift that's deep within
As the wonderful Spirit in us.
When we call "Lord Jesus" how our spirits spring
With this life-giving Spirit in us!

  Oh, He's the wonderful Spirit in us,
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!
  God, is in the Son, the Son's the Spirit now
  He's the wonderful Spirit in us!--------1114
The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
Our spirits rejoice in this living inflow.
For just as our body the breath does receive,
So also in spirit to live it is so.

The Spirit today is the air that we breathe;
What thing more important than breathing to do?
For breathing each moment, new life we receive,
And God's living freshness is constant and new.

For God has been processed, as air now, He's free;
This life-giving pneuma is all that we need.
He's rich and abundant, so plentiful, He,
In spirit to walk is to breathe Him indeed.

O, say, aren't you glad that the Spirit's outpoured
And God, fully processed, is flowing in us?
So freely we're breathing this life-giving Lord,
And breathing, receiving His life, glorious!--------1115
Ezekiel 47:1-12

We have come, we have come to the house of God;
We have come to the house, whence outflows the flood.
On the right, day and night, constant is its flow,
Watering us and causing fruits of life to grow.

From the house, from the house flows this living stream,
From the house, to the earth, with the life supreme.
Yet more deep, Lord, we seek that the flow may be;
Thus we must be measured and possessed by Thee.

Measure us, measure us, measure every day;
Measure us, measure more, measure all the way,
Till we know that the flow is a mighty flood,
Sweeping over all the earth for Christ the Lord.

Take us through, take us through, take us through the flow;
Take us through, through and through, everywhere we go.
Flow increase, never cease, till we swim in Thee,
Till we are immersed in God eternally.

All shall live, all shall live where the river comes;
All shall live, really live, everywhere it runs.
Let the fount from this mount life abundant bring,
Till the deserts of the earth with churches spring!--------1116
Exodus 30:22-25, 34-36

Pure myrrh and cinnamon,
Calamus and cassia
These are Thy elements,
Jesus my Lord!
In olive oil they're blent
In wondrous measurement
O what an ointment this,
Anointing us!

  Four-in-one mingled,
  Compounded Spirit,
  Sweet with Christ's suffering death,
  Full of fragrance
  Of resurrection
  O what an ointment flows
  In spirit, Lord!

Stacte and onycha,
Galbanum and frankincense
There are Thy elements,
Jesus my Lord!
Stacte doth sons produce,
Onycha from sin doth loose,
Galbanum all death repels,
In spirit, Lord.

  Equal proportion,
  In resurrection;
  Seasoned with salt are they.
  Ground into powder fine,
  Consumed with fire divine
  O what an incense this,
  Jesus my Lord!

Ointment is Christ for us,
Exceeding glorious!
Incense is Christ for God,
Wholly for Him.
Ointment flows down to us,
Christ is our portion thus;
Incense ascends to God,
Fragrant to Him.

'Tis by th' anointing
Christ we experience
And then the incense burn.
Christ in our prayer and praise
O what a Christ we raise
From our experience,
Precious to God.--------1117
We praise Thee, O God,
For the Spirit of Christ
Who has come to indwell us
And be all our life.

That never shall end!

In spirit we sing
Of the One who has come
As the life-giving Spirit
With us to be one.
Hallelujah! This is Jesus,
Hallelujah! Still more,
Hallelujah! He's the Spirit,
Our life evermore.

In spirit reborn,
We're being transformed,
And to God's Son completely
We'll soon be conformed.
Hallelujah! Life imparting,
Hallelujah! Transformed,
Hallelujah! Soon transfigured
And to Him conformed!

Conformed we will be
As in spirit we feed
On the life of the One
Who knows all that we need.

Hallelujah! So sufficient
For all of our lives.--------1118

The Holy Spirit is the seal,
The foretaste, earnest, and the pledge.
He designates us as God's own
And guarantees our heritage.

'Twas after we believed in Christ,
The word of truth, the gospel, heard,
The Holy Spirit us did seal
To show that we belong to God.

This Spirit as the living seal,
To us God's image now imparts;
Conforming us unto the Son,
He stamps His image in our hearts.

This Spirit also is the pledge,
Our earnest and our foretaste true.
He witnesses that we are sons,
With God's inheritance in view.

'Tis by this Spirit God does spread
Into our mind, emotion, will;
By sealing every inward part,
He will our very being fill.

Oh, Lord, we would cooperate
With all Thy Spirit's inward move;
That we'd become Thy masterpiece,
Th' eternal purpose thus to prove.--------1121
Can also use tune of #776

Praise the Lord, who firmly joined us
Unto the Anointed One.
Thus we all have been anointed
With th' anointing of the Son.

Now in Christ, in the anointing,
We are the anointed ones.
Oh, how blessed is this ointment
Poured upon the many sons!

Hallelujah, the anointing
Unto us God's essence brings;
It is now abiding in us,
And it teaches us all things.

We're the Lord's peculiar treasure,
Purchased by His precious blood.
He has put His seal upon us,
We are those marked out by God.

Day by day we're under sealing,
That we may His likeness share.
By the impress of His Person
We will Jesus' image bear.

Now we have the pledge, the foretaste,
Of the Christ we soon will see.
We are longing for the full taste
God, our feast eternally.

God has wrought us for this purpose,
Giving us the earnest here,
Guarantee of full enjoyment
Of our Lord Himself, so dear.

The anointing, seal, and earnest
In our spirit are all three.
Such a wondrous, blest deposit
God has given you and me.--------1122
"Seven Spirits" of our God
Lo, the age has now been turned
To the Spirit with the Son.
For the churches He's concerned.

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!

Sevenfold the Spirit is
For the deadness of the church,
That the saints may turn and live,
That the Lord may burn and search.

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!

Now the Spirit of our God
Has become intensified:
'Tis not one but sevenfold
That the church may be supplied!

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!

Now the seven Spirits are
Seven lamps of burning fire,
Not to teach us, but to burn,
Satisfying God's desire.

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!

See the seven Spirits now
Seven piercing, searching eyes.
In the church exposing us,
All the church He purifies.

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!

Seven Spirits doth the Lord
For the churches now employ;
All those in the local church
May this Spirit now enjoy.

  Come, O seven Spirits, come,
  Thy recovery work be done!
  Burn and search us thoroughly,
  All the churches are for Thee.
  Burn us, search us,
  All the churches are for Thee!--------1123
Of the Spirit, born of Spirit
This the source of Jesus is;
Filled with Spirit, all of Spirit
This the essence truly His.
In the Spirit, with the Spirit,
As the Spirit Jesus came;
Now the Lord is just that Spirit
And in spirit we're the same.

Baptized in the Holy Spirit,
In the Spirit we're immersed;
All the church is born of Spirit,
All religion is dispersed.
In the Spirit, in the Spirit
Brothers, this is all we need.
Now the church must be in Spirit,
Not in teaching, form, or creed.

The communion of the Spirit
Is the fellowship we share;
All the brothers, all the sisters
Only for the Spirit care.
Now the Spirit in the churches
Speaks to those who have an ear.
Seven Spirits for the churches
Are our blessed portion here.

"Come and drink the living water,"
Say the Spirit and the Bride
Church and Spirit speak together,
Utterly identified.
Just according to the Spirit
Must be our reality;
Just the Spirit in the churches
Is the Lord's recovery.--------1124
What! Not sing of blood divine?
What! Not tell to all mankind?
What! Not speak to hearts unclean
Of the precious living stream.

By this blood, God's life released,
Blood surpassing any beast's;
Perfect, spotless Lamb of God,
Incorruptible His blood.

Voice it has, this holy blood;
Pow'r possessed to speak with God;
Speaks it for us at the throne
With its glorious virtue shown.

Failure on our conscience is
Conscience means a "knowing this"
Causing us much grief and pain,
Telling us of every stain.

All the while we're unaware
Of the blood's effectual prayer.
Jesus' blood speaks of our case,
That we might receive His grace!

We need not dead works to bring,
Nor another offering.
Nothing else could please our God,
Heav'n is listening for His blood.

In His blood forgiveness shines;
Oh, 'tis glorious to find!
Israel just atonement knew,
We have that and cleansing too.

Heart and mind are now at peace
Rest! Our conscience has been reached.
Never more we blush in shame,
We are washed from every stain.

Hallelujah! Fathomless!
All that's in His blood for us!
Sing we will, and sing we must;
In His blood is all our trust!--------1125
Down at the cross where my Savior died,
God's righteous nature was satisfied;
There to my sin was the blood applied,
Glory to His name!

  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  There to my sin was the blood applied,
  Glory to His name!

Saved from our sin at this fountain, we
Fully enjoy our redemption free;
This we'll enjoy for eternity,
Glory to His name!

  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  There to my sin was the blood applied,
  Glory to His name!

Oh, precious fact, when my Savior died,
Not only sin's debt was satisfied;
Life's flowing fountain was opened wide,
Glory to His name!

  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  Life's flowing fountain was opened wide,
  Glory to His name!

Now both redemption and life we share,
Cleansed in His blood, we're abiding there
Drinking the water of life fore'er;
Glory to His name!

  Glory to His name,
  Glory to His name;
  Life's flowing fountain was opened wide,
  Glory to His name!--------1126
O Jesus Lord, we come to Thee,
Thy presence to enjoy;
Our entrance now with boldness is,
As we Thy blood employ.
Not by our merit do we stand,
Nor in our righteousness,
Thy blood and righteousness we need;
Their worth we now confess.

Thy judgments, Lord, we must admit,
Are holy, righteous, fair.
We own our sins as crimson are,
We've no excuse to bear.
We have no argument, no plea;
No veil our sin can hide.
But, praise Thee, Lord, Thy precious blood
Is to our sin applied!

God has not overlooked our sin,
But judged it once for all;
His righteous fury, not on us,
But on His Lamb did fall.
A new and living way is made
We stand on legal ground;
Our Surety and our Substitute
Has pardon for us found.

O Jesus Lord, we worship Thee,
Redemption now enjoy;
Thy precious blood again we see,
Its virtue now employ.
Dear Lord, Thy mercy is so vast,
Unlimited and free.
Oh, Lamb of God, we'll sing Thy praise,
Through all eternity!--------1127

Exodus 15:1-22

We were held in bondage, toiling down in Egypt land,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
But the God of Hebrews rescued us from Pharaoh's hand,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

  We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
  For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
  Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
  Glory to God, Hallelujah!

Now we're on the other side, we'll go back nevermore!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
Look! Th' Egyptians all are lying dead upon the shore!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

  We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
  For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
  Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
  Glory to God, Hallelujah!

Brothers, sisters  Hallelujah! Through the sea we've crossed,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
All the things that used to hold us are forever lost!
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

  We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
  For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
  Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
  Glory to God, Hallelujah!

We're the Hebrews, now we're standing on the sea of glass,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!
And we sing the song of Moses, everything we've passed,
Glory to God, Hallelujah!

  We will sing unto the Lord for His mighty victory,
  For the rider and the horse He has cast into the sea.
  Now the dwelling place of God on the earth will builded be,
  Glory to God, Hallelujah!--------1129
Hebrews 2:3

"So great a salvation," ye saints of the Lord,
To us is revealed in His marvelous Word!
Since all that He is and has done is for us,
We'll give earnest heed to this word glorious.

What He is of God and of Man as the Son,
We now may enjoy since with Him we are one;
Our High Priest and Captain  salvation is He!
He'll cause us to grow in His glory to be.

He's washed all our sins, purified them fore'er;
Tasted death on the cross, ended slavery there.
He took on our nature, the devil has slain,
And put you and I in His glorious train.

So great the extent of salvation to us
We're partners of Christ in His plan glorious.
He'll bring us to glory and we'll rule with Him,
To the uttermost saved by His working within.

To such a salvation our heed we must give,
Lest drifting away or neglecting we live.
Christ now as our life, future ruling with Him,
We'll miss if we miss this salvation within.

"So great a salvation" is given to us
That we may be made like our Lord glorious!
By all that He is and by all He has done
We're brought into glory with God's firstborn Son.--------1130
Hebrews 7

Sing praise to Christ Who lives in us,
The God of our salvation;
Who saves us by His life divine,
And not by regulation;
After we've worked  done all we can,
His life has power to change a man:
His life divine can change us.

He saves us to the uttermost
By His life-giving power;
Transfusing Himself into us,
He saves us hour by hour.
He saved the lost by coming in,
He's saving now from more than sin:
He's saving us to glory!

Our Lord was constituted priest
To be a real life-giver;
Life is the nature of this One
Who can from self deliver:
His life is indestructible,
By it He saves us to the full:
Praise God, He's fully able!

His life is fully qualified
To bring us through to glory;
Were it not for His tested life,
'Twould be another story:
His life was fully tried on earth,
To crucifixion from His birth:
He passed through death and Hades.

He's pledged to save us to the full,
His life is operating;
He's doing everything for us
'Tis all for our perfecting;
Our life's a failure at its best,
Only His life can stand the test:
His life brings full salvation!

He's living now to intercede,
Continuing forever;
He undertakes into the age,
His priesthood changes never;
He always lives to intercede,
Such a High Priest is what we need:
He's higher than the heavens.

Come forward now to God through Him,
Ne'er shrink back to destruction;
Come forward now to get the life,
Which brings the proper function;
Come forward now the life to take,
By life His people us He'll make,
And swallow death forever.--------1131
Romans 5:1-11

In a low dungeon, hope we had none;
Tried to believe, but faith didn't come;
God, our sky clearing, Jesus appearing,
We by God were transfused!
We by God were transfused!

  Propitiation made by the blood,
  Jesus' redemption bought us for God!
  No condemnation, justification!
  We have peace toward God!
  We have peace toward God!

Born into Adam, dying we were;
We had a sickness no one could cure.
God, His Son sending, old Adam ending;
He is dead, we are free!
He is dead, we are free!

  Propitiation made by the blood,
  Jesus' redemption bought us for God!
  No condemnation, justification!
  We have peace toward God!
  We have peace toward God!

Now we're rejoicing, standing in grace,
Oh hallelujah! Sin is erased!
God, in us flowing, in our hearts growing,
We are saved in His life!
We are saved in His life!

  Propitiation made by the blood,
  Jesus' redemption bought us for God!
  No condemnation, justification!
  We have peace toward God!
  We have peace toward God!--------1132
Lord, teach us how to pray,
Not as the nations do in vain,
But turn us from our way,
And cause us, Lord, to call on You each day
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Lord, You're the seed of life;
You've sown Yourself into our heart,
And now You have a start;
So day by day more life to us impart
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Lord Jesus, soften us;
You know the source from which we came.
By calling on Your name,
Lord, let no earth unturned nor rocks remain
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Lord, how Your light makes clear
That we could not but e'er fail You;
Yet there's a message true,
The seed of life within us will break through
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Make us in spirit poor;
Lord, take whate'er we think we know.
We'll open to life's flow,
And thus take in the life that makes us grow
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Lord, make us pure in heart;
For we'll be not content until
You all our being fill,
O Lord, renew our mind, emotion, will
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Yes, Lord, impress our heart
That we must take You in each day;
The seed will have its way;
Your growing brings the kingdom here to stay
Lord Jesus, grow in us.

Amen!  The growth in life!
There's nothing that Your life can't do;
Our every part renew.
We'll make it, we'll make it just by You.
Lord Jesus, grow in us.
Lord Jesus, grow in us.--------1133
Ephesians 1:17-23

O Father of glory, now grant unto me
A spirit of wisdom, a spirit to see;
O give unto me the full knowledge of Him,
Enlight'ning the eyes of my heart deep within.

O show me that Christ is the hope of Thy call
O glorious hope, Christ will fill all in all!
Reveal Him  the riches of glory in us
As God's own inheritance. How glorious!

O God of our Lord Jesus, let me perceive
Th' exceeding great pow'r unto us who believe,
The power that raised Christ, Thy Son, from the dead
And made Him o'er all, to His Body, the Head.

O God, Thou hast wrought all this pow'r into Christ,
Who now lives in me as my Person, my life.
O grant revelation, dear Father, to see
This transcending pow'r is a Person in me.

O Christ is the hope, He's the glory and power;
So Christ I must take as my Person each hour.
Then in me such power will be exercised,
My hope and God's glory will be realized.--------1134
Ephesians 3:17-20

Oh, strengthen my spirit, Lord Jesus,
Oh, strengthen my spirit, I pray;
Oh, strengthen my spirit with power
And spread to my heart today.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Spread into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Make home today and have Your way
  In all of my heart, Lord Jesus.

Spread into my heart, O Lord Jesus,
Spread into my heart, I pray;
Spread into my heart from my spirit,
Spread into my heart today.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Spread into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Make home today and have Your way
  In all of my heart, Lord Jesus.

Make home in my heart, O Lord Jesus,
Make home in my heart, I pray;
That we may be filled with Your fullness,
Make home in my heart today.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Spread into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Make home today and have Your way
  In all of my heart, Lord Jesus.

To Him who is able to do it
Above all we think or say,
We open our hearts wide and welcome
Him into our heart today.

  Into my heart, into my heart,
  Spread into my heart, Lord Jesus;
  Make home today and have Your way
  In all of my heart, Lord Jesus.--------1135
Ephesians 5:26-29

Oh, sanctify us, Lord; now add Thyself to us,
In our experience, Thy Person spread in us,
That in reality the church be glorious,
O Lord, do add Thyself, we pray.

  Oh, sanctify us, Lord, today;
  Lord Jesus, You're the only way.
  We take Your Person, Lord;
  Oh, spread Yourself abroad.
  Oh, sanctify us, Lord, today.

Oh, purify us, Lord, by speaking in our heart;
Thy living, spoken word this washing will impart.
Increase Thy speaking, Lord, and cleanse our every part.
Oh, purify us, Lord, we pray.

  Oh, purify us, Lord, today;
  Wash all our natural life away.
  Speak now Thy words in us,
  And make us glorious.
  O Lord, do speak in us today.

O Lord, do nourish us; You are the food we need;
As we are eating You, we'll be transformed indeed;
We're fully satisfied as on Yourself we feed,
So nourish us, O Lord, we pray.

  O Lord, do nourish us today
  As all our self You wash away.
  Not only purify,
  But fill and satisfy;
  O Lord, do nourish us today.

O Lord, do cherish us, as on Thyself we feed;
Warm us so tenderly and meet our every need.
Our hardness soften, Lord, till we are Yours indeed;
Oh, cherish us, dear Lord, we pray.

  O Lord, do cherish us today,
  Until our coldness flees away.
  Oh, hold us close to Thee
  And cherish tenderly;
  O Lord, do cherish us today.

Lord, make us glorious, by all Your inner work,
Not glory for ourselves, but glory for the church;
That You may have Your Bride, thus ending all Your search.
O Lord, do work on us, we pray.

  O Lord, do work on us today!
  To form the church Your glorious way.
  Oh, spread Yourself in us
  Till we are glorious;
  Oh, make us glorious, Lord, today.--------1136
Oh, Lord, grant us revelation,
Grant us light and sight to see
That as life, within our spirit,
Thou art our reality;
And that from within our spirit,
Now You must possess each part
Spreading out to all our being,
Making home in all our heart.

It is not the outward action
Pure behavior, conduct good,
Proper poise and perfect manners,
Doing what we think we should;
But it's Christ, a living Person,
Mingled thus with us within,
Spreading into all our being,
So that we might live by Him.

Oh, Lord, let our every action,
Everything we do and say,
Come from Thee alone, experienced
In a real and inner way.
We reject the empty teachings,
Leave the methods and the strife.
Let our only way of living
Be the overflow of life!

Following the inner feeling,
Living in the overflow,
Moving in the rich anointing,
Not by what we think or know,
Nothing through intent or motive,
Or with purpose duly done,
But just following this feeling,
Living by the living One!

Thus we're sanctified completely,
Saturated thoroughly;
Not the old religious concept:
Separated doctrinally.
But 'tis Christ Himself within us,
Added to our every part,
All supplying, satisfying,
Making home in all our heart.--------1137
His countenance angels can often behold,
But ne'er taste His love in His grace;
His saints, though they know of His pure boundless love,
Have never yet once seen His face.
His saints will before long His visage behold,
E'en in His bright glory will share;
But Mary, beholding His tears as He wept.
Could touch His heart's agony there.
Could touch His heart's agony there.

We'll soon see the Lord, as He is, face to face,
We'll know Him as never before;
But that touch today, healing our broken heart,
In that day will be felt no more.
That day, though our lips offer unceasing praise,
No tears, then, nor prayers fervent burn;
Nor is there the comfort received through much pain,
Nor trust gained through trials to learn,
Nor trust gained through trials to learn.

Exceeding in glory, that day we'll be crowned,
Yet there'll be no cross to obey;
The sweet fellowship of His suff'rings for us
We only can share in today.
Once we've that rest entered, no weariness then,
Nor chance will remain to partake
The trials nor the hardships, nor happiness lost,
Nor suffering borne for His sake,
Nor suffering borne for His sake.

Oh, chances to suffer for Him are so few,
His shame and derision to bear;
Such blest opportunities soon pass away,
That He in our troubles may share.
All loneliness, misunderstandings and scorn
Despisings and sorrows will flee;
I treasure these blessings, for through them, O Lord,
I enter sweet oneness with Thee,
I enter sweet oneness with Thee.

I long to behold, Lord, Thy countenance soon,
What rapture with Thee, Lord, to meet.
But neither seek I all these trials to avoid;
Such times, Lord, are too rare and sweet.
Have mercy on me, fill me with Thy great love,
For Thee, Lord, to live at all cost;
Lest Thy servant, hoping for that blessed day,
That day, regret chances were lost,
That day, regret chances were lost.--------1138
Lord, Thou art our consecration,
Thou the consecrated One;
Thou has satisfied the Father
Consecration thus was done.
When on earth Thou hadst no pleasure,
Save to do the Father's will;
Now Thou livest here within us,
Consecration to fulfill.

Lord, we praise Thee for the picture:
Consecration's ram we see,
Burnt for God's full satisfaction,
Eaten and enjoyed to be.
Thou art now our ram, Lord Jesus,
Offered for the will of God;
By Thy consecration, faultless,
We may walk where Thou hast trod.

As we eat Thyself, Lord Jesus,
Consecrated we become;
By Thy wondrous life within us,
Thy obedience is our own.
No more need we strive and struggle,
Consecrated try to be;
Consecration dwells within us
Now our part to eat of Thee.

Lord, we praise Thee, consecration
Is nought else but Thee as food:
As we eat Thee and enjoy Thee,
We are all made one with God;
One in will and one in purpose
We become by eating Thee:
As we take and eat Thyself, Lord,
Consecrated we will be.--------1139
Song of Songs 4:6

I will get me to the mountain,
I will get me to the hill;
In Thy death and resurrection,
Jesus, take me deeper still.

  I will get me to the mountain,
  Willingly would get me there.
  All my self fore'er forsaking,
  One with Thee, O Lord,
  Thy death to share.

Still at times I sense the shadows
Of my nature, untransformed;
Lord, I'll go unto the mountain,
To Thy death to be conformed.

  I will get me to the mountain,
  Willingly would get me there.
  All my self fore'er forsaking,
  One with Thee, O Lord,
  Thy death to share.

On the mountain till the daybreak,
Linger I, Lord, thus with Thee,
May Thy all-transforming Spirit
Saturate me thoroughly.

  I will get me to the mountain,
  Willingly would get me there.
  All my self fore'er forsaking,
  One with Thee, O Lord,
  Thy death to share.

Mingled with Thee on the mountain,
Soon my sun begins to shine;
Death has worked her deep impression,
Now my nature's one with Thine.

  I will get me to the mountain,
  Willingly would get me there.
  All my self fore'er forsaking,
  One with Thee, O Lord,
  Thy death to share.--------1140
Romans 7

Our old man has been crucified with Christ;
Yes, all we are in oldness He sufficed
To bring to naught upon the cross that He
Himself as our new Husband fully be
Enjoyed by us.

Yes, all our strength of independence died,
For we with Christ were fully crucified.
Now we're so glad to be His proper wife,
Dependently enjoying Him as life
Forevermore.

Our dying was not such a sad affair,
The new man was rejoicing to be there;
The old man dead and buried, we were free
To marry Christ, and live eternally,
His wife, fore'er.

Now as the new, regenerated man,
We do two things, according to God's plan:
Bear fruit to God and serve in spirit new
So God becomes the fruit of all we do,
And all we are.

There are three laws in Romans seven, see
The law of God; the mind, the good old me;
The sinful law indwelling bodily;
Yet from these all the Lord has set us free,
To live by Him.

In Romans eight the law of Spirit is,
Where we're in Christ, and we are fully His,
The law of life has set us wholly free
And Christ becomes our life eternally,
Hallelujah!--------1141
We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,
We will sing to the Lord from within,
We will sing hallelujah to Jesus;
And be blent into oneness with Him.

We have been many years in religion,
We have been many years in our mind,
We have been many years in emotions,
Always seeking, but never to find.

Now we're learning to turn to our spirit,
Now we're learning to take Christ as life;
Now we're learning to feed upon Jesus
And be freed from all struggling and strife.

Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,
Hallelujah for newness within.
When we turn from our mind to our spirit,
We enjoy all the riches of Him.--------1142
Jesus is the living Spirit,
Our reality;
We enjoy Him just by calling
In simplicity.

  Jesus is the living Spirit,
  We must now proclaim;
  He is rich unto all men
  That call upon His name.

He is living now within us,
Giving liberty;
He is good and He is gracious
As we taste and see.

  Jesus is the living Spirit,
  We must now proclaim;
  He is rich unto all men
  That call upon His name.

Jesus is the living Spirit
And the living Word;
When we touch Him by pray-reading
We receive this Lord.

  Jesus is the living Spirit,
  We must now proclaim;
  He is rich unto all men
  That call upon His name.

Jesus is the living Spirit
Who among us flows;
Fellowship of life in spirit
Unity bestows.

  Jesus is the living Spirit,
  We must now proclaim;
  He is rich unto all men
  That call upon His name.

Jesus is the living Spirit,
He is our rich feast;
As the Body now enjoys Him,
Praises are released.

  Jesus is the living Spirit,
  We must now proclaim;
  He is rich unto all men
  That call upon His name.--------1143
The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,
With God as life complete.
I once was dead, but now I live,
Was starved, but now I eat.

'Twas God that brought me to the tree,
With Christ Himself as meat;
How precious did that tree become
When I began to eat.

The Lord Himself is food to me,
He is my life supply;
He will my pure enjoyment be,
None else can satisfy.

I freely eat this living tree,
For eating is the way
To put God's life inside of me,
To live by Him today.--------1144
In the Word of old, we are clearly told,
In His image God created man.
To express His worth, to subdue the earth,
Have dominion and fulfill His plan.

  Image, image,
  In His image He created man.
  Image, image,
  For dominion, to fulfill His plan.

Yet no rules He gave, no instructions, save:
"Every tree shall be to thee for meat."
But one tree, He said, surely makes you dead;
Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.

  Knowledge, knowledge,
  Fruit of knowledge wasn't meant for meat.
  Knowledge, knowledge,
  Fruit of knowledge isn't good to eat.

Midst the garden fair, see the life tree there
God Himself the tree of life does show.
But the enemy, somehow subtly
Tempted man the other tree to know.

  Fallen, fallen,
  Man has eaten of the deadly tree.
  Fallen, fallen,
  Man requires a full recovery.

Then came Jesus Christ as the tree of life,
Satisfying all that God required.
He redeemed the earth, giving man new birth.
And became the food that man desired.

  Jesus, Jesus,
  Jesus Christ is really good to eat.
  Jesus, Jesus,
  He is real drink and real meat.

Jesus ne'er designed e'er to feed our mind;
All good knowledge only puffeth up.
But He came, He said, as a feast instead,
Not to analyze, but only sup.

  Take Him, take Him,
  Wholly satisfying, glorious.
  Take Him, take Him,
  Jesus is the tree of life to us.

As we eat the Lord, growth He does afford,
Life and numbers soon will be increased.
We must clearly see God's recovery
Christ is not religion, but a feast.

  Eat Him, eat Him,
  Christ as life is all the food we need.
  Eat Him, eat Him,
  He who eateth Him shall live indeed.

Eating is the way to live Christ today,
Of the eating there should be no lack.
As the churches eat, they become complete,
Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.

  Eating, eating,
  Of our eating there must be no lack.
  Eating, eating,
  Eating Christ will bring the Bridegroom back.--------1145
God gave His Son to man to be
The tree of life so rich and free,
That every man may taste and see
That God is good for food.

  Yes, God is good for food!
  Yes, God is good for food!
  We've tasted and we testify
  That God is good for food!

We eat this feast and take God in,
And as we eat we live by Him,
For all the elements within
This feast are God Himself.

  Yes, Jesus is our feast!
  Yes, Jesus is our feast!
  We eat this feast and live by Him,
  For Jesus is our feast!

Christ Jesus is the food we eat;
He is our bread, He is our meat;
He is our life-supply complete;
We daily eat of Him.

  We daily eat of Him,
  We daily eat of Him.
  He is our life-supply complete;
  We daily eat of Him.

This feast is so enjoyable;
To men it's so available,
For God said whosoever will
May come and freely eat.

  Yes, come and freely eat;
  Yes, come and freely eat.
  For God said whosoever will
  May come and freely eat.--------1146
Let us eat Jesus every day,
Eating His flesh in such a way
That in the trials great or small
He as a Man will be our all.

  Eat, eat more of Jesus!
  Eat, eat more of Jesus!
  Why should we undernourished be
  When we have His humanity?

Let us drink Jesus till we see
That we are human, Jesusly!
Till rivers flood the barren ground
And quench the thirst of all around.

  Drink, drink more of Jesus!
  Drink, drink more of Jesus!
  Why should we ever thirsty be
  When we have His humanity?

We must eat Jesus till God can
Have the fulfillment of His plan
One man expressed for all to see,
One church in each locality.

  We'll masticate Jesus!
  We'll masticate Jesus!
  Then to the tent of meeting bring
  Jesus, our real meal offering.--------1147
Exodus 16

Christ is our manna true,
Our bread of life indeed;
He's our supply of nourishment,
As on Him now we feed.

From Egypt Israel fled
Into a desert land;
Egyptian food they left behind,
And wandering began.

One day, the manna fell,
Oh, what a wondrous feat;
This was the bread the Lord had giv'n
For Israel to eat.

Unique this manna is,
It comes with morning dew;
The visit of God's grace it is,
Forever fresh and new.

God is majestic, high,
And greater than us all;
But that we may partake of Him,
In Christ, He's fine and small.

Though ground, or beat, or baked,
He's so available;
As bread and cakes and wafers fresh,
We eat Him to the full.

Manna shows Him to be
The germ of life, the seed;
'Tis God Himself sown into us,
The source of all we need.

Between the morning dew
And cold of winter snow,
This manna too is frost which kills
Things negative below.

How pure and white and clean;
In type our Christ we see;
As we digest His element,
He washes inwardly.

10 Manna with honey is;
Two lives this type does show;
One for the Lord's redemptive work,
And one His life to grow.

11 By eating more of Christ
We'll be the less opaque;
We'll then appear as bdellium,
Transparent us to make.

12 Lord, as we're eating here
And in the manna see
The riches of this glorious Christ,
We're filled with praise to Thee.--------1148
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine"
We can eat and drink of Jesus all the time!
He's our daily food supply,
Only He can satisfy.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine."

"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine."
When we eat and drink of Jesus all the time,
He becomes our life within,
And He fills us to the brim.
"Come and dine," the Lord is calling,
"Come and dine."--------1149
Of Him whence grace and truth did spring,
We're at the fountain drinking;
This Christ we'll ever praise and sing,
Here in the church, His home!

  Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
  Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!

Ask but His grace, and lo, 'tis giv'n,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Seek but Himself, the heaven of heaven,
And find Him here at home!

  Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
  Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!

Though Satan fights with all His power,
We're at the fountain drinking;
He'll not prevail, not one short hour,
Against the church, our home!

  Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
  Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!

Athirst we to this spring do fly,
We're at the fountain drinking;
Drink deep, this well will not run dry!
It's in the church, our home!

  Glory to God! We're at the fountain drinking!
  Glory to God! We're in the church, our home!--------1150
We're feeding on the living bread,
We're drinking at the fountainhead;
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.
What, never thirst again? No, never thirst again!
What, never thirst again? No, never thirst again!
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again!

We are feeding on the living bread,
Eating of the feast our Lord has spread,
And whoso eateth, Jesus said,
Shall hunger nevermore.
What, hunger nevermore? Yes, hunger nevermore!
What, hunger nevermore? Yes, hunger nevermore!
And whoso eateth, Jesus said,
Shall hunger nevermore.

We are breathing in the living air,
Breathing in the One whose life we share,
And whoso breatheth  now, fore'er
Shall have the life of God.
What, have the life of God? Yes, have the life of God!
What, have the life of God? Yes, have the life of God!
And whoso breatheth  now, fore'er
Shall have the life of God.

We are tasting of the living wine,
In spirit tasting life divine,
And whoso tasteth, everytime
Shall have the joy of God.
What, have the joy of God? Yes, have the joy of God!
What, have the joy of God? Yes, have the joy of God!
And whoso tasteth, everytime
Shall have the joy of God.

Christ is the resurrected King,
Who died and rose, our life to bring,
If you receive Him you will sing,
And live forevermore.
What, live forevermore? Yes, live forevermore!
What, live forevermore? Yes, live forevermore!
If you receive Him you will sing,
And live forevermore.--------1151
Revelation 22

Drink! A river pure and clear that's flowing from the throne;
Eat! The tree of life with fruits abundant, richly grown;
Look! No need of lamp nor sun nor moon to keep it bright, for
Here there is no night!

  Do come, oh, do come,
  Says Spirit and the Bride:
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him that heareth, cry.
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him who thirsts and will
  Take freely the water of life!

Christ, our river, Christ, our water, springing from within;
Christ, our tree, and Christ, the fruits, to be enjoyed therein,
Christ, our day, and Christ, our light, and Christ, our morning star:
Christ, our everything!

  Do come, oh, do come,
  Says Spirit and the Bride:
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him that heareth, cry.
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him who thirsts and will
  Take freely the water of life!

We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;
"O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!"  Jesus is so sweet!
We our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.
What a Christ have we!

  Do come, oh, do come,
  Says Spirit and the Bride:
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him that heareth, cry.
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him who thirsts and will
  Take freely the water of life!

Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,
Where the brothers all unite and truly are one.
Jesus gets us all together, Him we now display
In the local church.

  Do come, oh, do come,
  Says Spirit and the Bride:
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him that heareth, cry.
  Do come, oh, do come,
  Let him who thirsts and will
  Take freely the water of life!--------1152
To Jesus every day we find our hearts are closer drawn;
He's fairer than the sons of men and fresher than the morn;
He's all that we can say of Him in fairest words and more,
And every day He's dearer than He was the day before!

  The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
  And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!

His glory broke upon us when we saw Him in the church,
For here are all His riches, here we've given up our search;
'Tis here He satisfies our longing spirits o'er and o'er,
And every day He's dearer than He was the day before.

  The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
  And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!

Now He's the living Spirit who within our spirit dwells,
And by His sweet anointing, how His life within us swells!
As with the saints we're meeting, full released our spirits soar,
For now our Lord is dearer than He ever was before.

  The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
  And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!

The Lord has made us one with Him for His recovery:
The riches of this Christ, the church His fullness, men must see.
Yes, all we have and all we are, we every day outpour
For His tremendous purpose, ever dearer than before.

  The half cannot be fancied of such a treasure-store,
  And every day He's dearer than He ever was before!--------1153
We have found the Christ who's all in all;
He is everything to us;
O how blest upon His name to call,
How divine, how glorious!

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the half has never yet been told!

We have found that Christ the Spirit is
Who within our spirit dwells;
How available, how near He is,
And His sweetness all excels.

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the half has never yet been told!

We have found the way to live by Christ
Pray His Word and call His name!
This  the eating, drinking  has sufficed
And its worth we now proclaim.

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the half has never yet been told!

We have found the local church, our home;
We are home and home indeed!
Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
In the church is all we need.

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the half has never yet been told!

We have found that meeting with the saints
Is the greatest joy on earth;
'Tis by this our spirit never faints
And our lives are filled with worth.

  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  Full of glory, full of glory;
  It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
  And the half has never yet been told!--------1154
  Song of Songs
  Repeat the last three lines of each verse

I love Thee, Jesus,
And Thy love to me
Draws me, ever to seek Thee
And run after Thee,
Draws me, ever to seek Thee
And run after Thee.
Thou art beloved,
Yea! Altogether lovely,
The One in whom my heart delighteth.

Thy love, Lord Jesus,
Is sweeter than wine,
And Thy fragrance of ointments
My heart doth entwine,
And Thy fragrance of ointments
My heart doth entwine.
A fount in gardens,
A well of living waters,
Which streams and flows from Lebanon's mountains.

O come Beloved,
On my garden blow,
That the odor of spices
May break forth and flow,
That the odor of spices
May break forth and flow.
My spouse, My sister,
I'm come into My garden
To feast upon wine, milk and honey.

Set me, Lord Jesus,
As seal on Thine heart;
Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,
And love's strong as death.
Jealousy's cruel as Sheol,
And love's strong as death.
Much water cannot
Quench love, nor do floods drown it.
All man could give for love is contemned.--------1155
  Song of Songs
(Tune: with chorus, #268; without chorus, #466)

How I love Thee, precious Jesus,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast drawn and wooed and kissed me
That a lover I may be!

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

As a company of horses,
Thou, O Lord, has likened me,
Strong and swift, with Pharaoh's chariots,
Full of natural energy.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

Just a lover with the dove's eyes
Fixed on Him and Him alone;
Changed are all my natural concepts,
Oh, the Lord in me has grown!

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

Now a lily of the valley,
Standing out among the thorns,
In the Lord alone I'm trusting,
Of my self-strength I've been shorn.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

Make us doves that hide in Thee, Lord;
Bring us to the secret place.
There You find our voices sweet, Lord,
And desire to see our face.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

Make us then, Lord, smoking pillars,
Coming from the wilderness.
By Thy death and resurrection
All our natural will suppress.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

You desire a couch to rest on
We become a rest to Thee;
Thou the Person in our being,
Gone our personality.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

Now a palanquin You're making
Nothing natural You'll allow.
For Your move and Your expression
Start this work within us now!

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

You supply the wood and pillars
For the structure and support,
Bottom gold and seat of purple
For our King of royal court.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

10 Only this, O Lord, we offer
For Thy palanquin so fine:
Just our love, so pure and fitted,
The interior design.

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.

11 What a sight when our Beloved
Wears a crown upon His brow;
Christ, the Church, are now united
Boast and glory to Him now!

  Our Beloved, how we love Him,
  So attractive, our delight.
  We are captivated wholly
  And are comely in His sight.--------1156
  Song of Songs
*henna: an Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Songs 1:!4)

To the Lord we're as a garden,
Out from which the spices flow;
All the precious fruits of Jesus
Freely in this garden grow.

  Spikenard, saffron, henna* flower,
  Cinnamon and calamus,
  Frankincense and myrrh and aloes;
  O Lord, we would ever grow Thee thus.

O Lord, come into Thy garden,
Come, Beloved, come and eat
Freely for Thy satisfaction
Of Thy fruit, abundant, sweet.

  "Yea," Thou answerest, "I am eating
  Honeycomb with honey pure."
  All sweet spices from Thy garden,
  Doth Thy satisfaction, Lord, secure.

All the produce of the garden
Is with resurrection filled
That the Lord may have a city,
Fruits of resurrection build.

  From the garden to the city,
  Growth transformed to precious stone;
  Christ is thus expressed, reflected
  God in all His glory fully shown.

Now the city, fair and comely,
As the dawn, triumphantly,
Is an army strong and mighty
Marching forth in victory.

  Lo, the city and the army
  Saints transformed in one accord.
  What a terror to the devil,
  And so beautiful unto the Lord!--------1157
Song of Songs 2:3-4

His banner over me is love,
His banner over me is love;
He brought me into His banqueting house,
And His banner over me is love.

  Is love! Is love!
  His banner over me is love;
  He brought me into His banqueting house,
  And His banner over me is love.

His fruit is sweet unto my taste,
His fruit is sweet unto my taste;
I'm feasting here in His banqueting house,
And His fruit is sweet unto my taste.

  How sweet! How sweet!
  His fruit is sweet unto my taste;
  I'm feasting here in His banqueting house,
  And His fruit is sweet unto my taste.--------1158
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Thou hast won each love from me;
Who like Thee  so fair and comely?
Who like Thee  so sweet and lovely?
Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
None can e'er compete with Thee!

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Gladly will I hear Thy call;
Since Thy voice my heart hath entered,
I from all things could but sever;
Void are all my other seekings,
Every pride hath disappeared.

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
How can I still stubborn be?
At Thy feet cast all my hard'nings,
And return with songs and singings;
'Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,
'Tis my joy to Thee obey.

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Thy way only will I choose;
Though in tears while I'm obeying,
Yet I would not change my standing;
All I long for is Thy pleasure,
And the peace Thy love would bring.

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
When Thy presence does depart,
Seems the dawn has lost its traces,
Hidden are my smiling faces;
All I yearn for is Thy coming
And Thy presence' sweet embrace.

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Can I tell it all to Thee?
Thou my love and satisfaction,
Thou my everlasting portion;
Thou art all that I desire,
Nothing else I would pursue.

Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
All I have I give to Thee;
Who like Thee  so fair and comely?
Who like Thee  so sweet and lovely?
Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
None can e'er compete with Thee!--------1159
Jesus Lord, I'm captured by Thy beauty.
All my heart to Thee I open wide;
Now set free from all religious duty,
Only let me in Thyself abide.
As I'm gazing here upon Thy glory,
Fill my heart with radiancy divine;
Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,
Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.

Shining One  how clear the sky above me!
Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!
Holy One, the flames of God consume me,
Till my being glows with Thee alone.
Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,
All self-love and glory sank in shame;
Now my heart its love and praises render,
Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.

Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster
Gladly now I break in love for Thee;
I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;
Lord, behold, I've saved the best for Thee.
Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;
Loving Thee, I'm deeply satisfied.
Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,
Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.

My Beloved, come on spices' mountain;
How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
Drink, dear Lord, from my heart's flowing fountain,
Till I rest fore'er in Thine embrace.
Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.--------1160
Jesus is our lovely Bridegroom,
And our Bridegroom is with us!
Now our praying's turned to praising
In His presence glorious.

  O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!
  Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
  How we treasure Thy dear presence
  O what bliss and joy complete!

We are fellows of the Bridegroom
And our fasting days have ceased.
With the Bridegroom in His chamber,
Joyfully we keep the feast.

  O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!
  Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
  How we treasure Thy dear presence
  O what bliss and joy complete!

We as virgins may enjoy Him,
Virgins simple, single, chaste.
Going forth to meet the Bridegroom,
Out from all the world we haste.

  O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!
  Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
  How we treasure Thy dear presence
  O what bliss and joy complete!

We are guests by God invited
To His Son's great wedding feast.
Brothers, sisters, hallelujah,
From religion we're released!

  O our Bridegroom! O our Bridegroom!
  Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
  How we treasure Thy dear presence
  O what bliss and joy complete!

Now rejoice with joy excelling,
Joy of joys, all else beside
Not just fellows, guests, or virgins,
Hallelujah, we're the Bride!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Lord, Thou art our Bridegroom sweet!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  O what bliss and joy complete!--------1161

*henna: an Old World plant, prized for its fragrant yellow and white flowers. (Song of Songs 1:!4)

Christ will make His seeking lover
Pillar, couch, and palanquin,
E'en a crown, His boast and glory;
He will do it all! Amen!

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.

But there still remains a shadow;
Christ is still not satisfied.
He must have a growing garden
To become His loving Bride!

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.

Paradise of pomegranates,
Pleasant fruits, and henna* flowers,
Spikenard, saffron, myrrh, and aloes:
His enjoyment now  not ours.

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.

He has come into His garden,
Gathered myrrh and spices there,
Eaten honeycomb and honey;
Wine and milk He'll drink fore'er.

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.

From the garden comes the city.
All materials thus supplied;
God is satisfied completely,
And the foe is terrified.

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.

"Thou art fair, my love, as Tirzah,
Comely as Jerusalem."
O Lord Jesus, Hallelujah,
Thou wilt do it all! Amen!

  His beloved  how He loves her,
  So attractive, His delight.
  He is captivated wholly;
  She is comely in His sight.--------1162
John 15

We've found the secret of living,
We've seen the vision divine:
We are of God in Christ Jesus,
We're abiding, abiding in the vine.

  Abiding in the vine,
  Abiding in the vine,
  All the riches of God's life are mine!
  Praise God, He put us here,
  Never to leave; oh, we're
  Abiding, abiding in the vine.

No more in vain need we struggle,
Trying the way in to find.
Praise God  we're in Him already,
Hallelujah, abiding in the vine.

  Abiding in the vine,
  Abiding in the vine,
  All the riches of God's life are mine!
  Praise God, He put us here,
  Never to leave; oh, we're
  Abiding, abiding in the vine.

In us, the ointment is moving,
'Tis the anointing divine;
God's precious essence bestowing,
While abiding, abiding in the vine.

  Abiding in the vine,
  Abiding in the vine,
  All the riches of God's life are mine!
  Praise God, He put us here,
  Never to leave; oh, we're
  Abiding, abiding in the vine.

Now in the life-flow we're living,
O how the light in us shines!
Both God and man are at home now
By the mutual abiding in the vine.

  Abiding in the vine,
  Abiding in the vine,
  All the riches of God's life are mine!
  Praise God, He put us here,
  Never to leave; oh, we're
  Abiding, abiding in the vine.--------1163
John 15

He's the vine and we're the branches,
We should e'er abide in Him,
And let Him abide within us
As the flow of life within.

  In the vine, in the vine,
  In the vine, in the vine,
  We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.

As we hear His instant speaking,
He's the rich indwelling Word;
To abide we must be faithful
To the speaking that we've heard.

  In the vine, in the vine,
  In the vine, in the vine,
  We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.

For 'tis here we know abiding
In the real and deepest way;
If we love our Lord completely,
We would do whate'er He'd say.

  In the vine, in the vine,
  In the vine, in the vine,
  We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.

Then His love abides within us,
And in love abiding, we
Know the joy of life-communion,
Full and perfect harmony.

  In the vine, in the vine,
  In the vine, in the vine,
  We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.

Oh, how precious this abiding,
Oh, how intimate and sweet;
As the fruit of life is added,
And our joy is made complete.

  In the vine, in the vine,
  In the vine, in the vine,
  We would know Thee, Lord, more deeply,
  E'er abiding in the vine.--------1164
Deuteronomy 8:7-10

Jesus, the all-inclusive land,
Is everything to me:
A Christ of brooks, of depths and streams,
And fountains bubbling free.
Springing from valleys and from hills,
Flowing till every part He fills,
He waters us  how glorious
By His life!

Jesus is now the land of wheat
Incarnate, crucified.
But resurrection life is He
By barley signified.
He is a land of figs and vines
Blood of the grape, the cheering wine.
With such supplies He satisfies
Christ our land!

O what a rich, abundant Christ:
Our pomegranate true,
The olive tree whose oil is now
Anointing us anew,
Rich milk and honey He doth bring,
Sweet, satisfying, nourishing.
Our Christ is such; He is so much!
What a Christ!

In our good land we eat the bread
There is no scarcity.
We never lack one thing in Him,
So rich, so full is He.
He is a land so vast, immense;
He is complete in every sense.
How He expands  land of all lands
In our heart!

Christ is a land of iron stones,
Whence comes authority.
We must dig out this solid Christ
To bind His enemy.
Then we must through the sufferings pass
To be refined as burnished brass.
With iron bind, as brass refined,
Is our need.

Lord, how we bless Thee for this land,
The all-inclusive Christ!
We've eaten Him, we're filled with Him,
O how He has sufficed!
Teach us to labor constantly
Upon this vast reality;
This is our joy, this our employ
Christ our land!--------1165
We're in the land, we're in the land!
O Hallelujah! In the land!
Christ is the land, Christ is the land,
O praise the Lord, He is the land!

  He is the milk and honey, too;
  The grain, the oil, the wine so new.
  We're in the land! We're in the land!
  O Hallelujah! In the land!

This land includes so many things:
Wheat, barley, vines, deep-flowing springs,
Fig trees and never-failing bread
O what a land before us spread!

  To have the produce and abound
  We daily labor on the ground;
  Then to the meetings we will bring
  The topmost Christ, our offering!--------1166
Deuteronomy 8:7-10

God has set the land before us,
And the land we will possess.
God has finally found a people
Tired of the wilderness.
Down with every weight and sin;
Let's go up and enter in.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

God has cleared the way before us
Through the victory of His Son;
Raised the Victor's banner o'er us,
All the battles He has won.
All that's left for us to do
Is by faith to follow through.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

It's a land of hills and valleys,
Brooks of water flowing free;
Fountains rich with living water,
Streams that flow abundantly.
Brothers, joyfully we stand
In His promise, Christ the land.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

God has made the fruit to grow here,
Filled the land with produce sweet:
Olive oil and pomegranates,
Fig trees, honey, vines and wheat.
We need nothing else besides,
All we need the land provides.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

We have eaten unto fullness,
And with joy we bless the Lord,
For the good land He has given;
Faithful to His promised Word.
Here we find there is no lack
Never, never we'll go back!

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

All we need to do is labor,
Working on the land each day;
Not expecting 'manna' blessing,
Working in a normal way.
God and man cooperating
While for harvest we are waiting.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.

Labor thus will bring the increase
Of the land with all its worth,
And the Lord will have the harvest,
When He comes to reap the earth.
To provide the Lord the way,
We must labor day by day.

  Hallelujah, Hallelujah,
  Hallelujah, Amen.--------1167
Laboring on the good land, laboring in the morning,
Laboring through the noontime to the early eve,
Laboring for a harvest, reaping all the produce,
Coming to the meeting, bringing in the sheaves.

  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

Reaping wheat and barley, death and resurrection,
Though the loss sustained our old man often grieves;
But in life abundant, life in resurrection,
Coming to the meeting, bringing in the sheaves.

  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!

Grain and wine and oil  bringing in the surplus
Of the wheat and barley, vine and olive trees:
Wine to cause rejoicing, oil to give anointing,
Bringing in the top tenth, bringing in the sheaves.

  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!
  Bringing in the sheaves, bringing in the sheaves,
  Here we are rejoicing, bringing in the sheaves!--------1168
Laboring on Jesus, the good land so real,
Plowing and planting and watering the field.
He yields the produce of reality,
God reaps the harvest of Jesus in me.

  O Jesus! You're God's good land
  For me to labor on!
  I'll bit by bit possess You
  Until the whole is won!
  With Canaan is God's purpose,
  The labor He will bless;
  Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.

Laboring on Jesus! My heart has been set,
Labor's begun, and I have no regret,
For with my labor God's sending the rain,
And all my labor on Christ yields much gain.

  O Jesus! You're God's good land
  For me to labor on!
  I'll bit by bit possess You
  Until the whole is won!
  With Canaan is God's purpose,
  The labor He will bless;
  Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.

Laboring on Jesus this practical way
Praying His Word in the spirit each day,
Foll'wing His living anointing within,
Built up with others, the church life to win.

  O Jesus! You're God's good land
  For me to labor on!
  I'll bit by bit possess You
  Until the whole is won!
  With Canaan is God's purpose,
  The labor He will bless;
  Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.

Laboring on Jesus yields reality,
Meetings of fullness for all men to see;
There God and man are indeed satisfied,
And there God's presence cannot be denied.

  O Jesus! You're God's good land
  For me to labor on!
  I'll bit by bit possess You
  Until the whole is won!
  With Canaan is God's purpose,
  The labor He will bless;
  Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.

Labor on Jesus to have Him increased!
Then seek God's dwelling and come to the feast!
There bring and offer your surplus to God,
There eat the riches, rejoice in the Lord!

  O Jesus! You're God's good land
  For me to labor on!
  I'll bit by bit possess You
  Until the whole is won!
  With Canaan is God's purpose,
  The labor He will bless;
  Lord Jesus, here I gain Yourself,
  Your Person to possess.--------1169
Our worship in reality
Is typified in Moses' law:
With Canaan's produce, rich and sweet,
All Israel came and worshipped God.

'Tis thus that we must come today
To worship in reality:
When we bring Christ as produce sweet
God fully satisfied will be.

The worship that God so desired
Was not with manna sent from heav'n,
But from their labor on the land
The people's gifts to God were giv'n.

Thus, what God so desires today.
Are not the miracles so grand,
But daily, normal life in Christ,
As worship, produce of the land.

The manna came from God alone;
The produce, from man's work on Him.
So all our worship now must come
From mingling with the Lord within.

As day by day we live in Christ,
And take Him as our everything,
The produce of the land comes forth
And worship true to God we'll bring.

The manna, Lord, no more we'll seek,
But Christ in all we will apply;
Then we will have some produce sweet,
Thine own dear heart to satisfy.--------1170
Psalm 23

The Lord is my Shepherd forever,
He maketh me down to lie,
He leads me beside the still waters
O how He does satisfy!

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
  And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;

My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,
My Shepherd, the waters of rest;
I eat of His riches in spirit,
I drink, and O how I am blest!

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
  And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;

My Shepherd my soul is restoring,
My will, and emotion, and mind;
And though through the valley I'm walking,
O what a Companion I find!

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
  And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;

A table prepared by my Shepherd
I feast on and Satan destroy;
My head is anointed with oil,
My cup runneth over with joy!

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
  And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;

And now in His house I am dwelling
Enjoying the goodness of God;
My pleasure is far beyond telling,
My pleasure is Jesus my Lord!

  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;
  And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
  And I shall feast at the table spread for me;
  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
  All the days, all the days of my life;--------1171
In the Testament of old
See th' acacia wood with gold;
Such humanity behold!
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
praise the Lord!

Jesus is th' acacia wood
What a man, so fine and good!
All corruption He withstood
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
praise the Lord!

Jesus, wisdom of God's plan,
Son of God and Son of Man;
A new manhood He began
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
praise the Lord!

For since by the one came death,
By this man came living breath;
Man the Lord recovereth
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
praise the Lord!

Types and shadows to us show
Jesus is the man to know.
Now this man in us must grow
Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord!

Lord, may Thy humanity
Permeate us thoroughly,
Drawing many men to Thee
Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord!--------1172
Lo, the conflict of the ages
Is upon us today,
And the forces of rebellion
Are in total array.
The humanity of Jesus
Now the saints must possess,
His true image and dominion
On the earth to express.

  Let us stand up in Jesus
  In His full human life,
  Human virtues prevailing
  'Gainst corruption so rife;
  In this wickedness concerted,
  In this age perverse, perverted,
  The humanity of Jesus
  Must the church now display.

Lo, how Satan came to damage
Human life on the earth;
But the Lord in all this ruin
Raised a man full of worth!
From the seed of the woman
God incarnated became
The man Jesus  the last Adam
To destroy Satan's aim!

  Let us stand up in Jesus
  In His full human life,
  Human virtues prevailing
  'Gainst corruption so rife;
  In this wickedness concerted,
  In this age perverse, perverted,
  The humanity of Jesus
  Must the church now display.

It's by calling, drinking, eating
The man Jesus today,
His humanity enjoying
Bruises Satan each day.
To the Lord we must be turning,
All our soul life deny,
To destroy all Satan's working
And the new man supply.

  Let us stand up in Jesus
  In His full human life,
  Human virtues prevailing
  'Gainst corruption so rife;
  In this wickedness concerted,
  In this age perverse, perverted,
  The humanity of Jesus
  Must the church now display.

See the ruin of a nation
Going downward in sin;
All humanity is fallen
And corrupted within.
But as children of the kingdom
We are salting the earth;
His humanity preserves us
In the midst of such dearth.

  Let us stand up in Jesus
  In His full human life,
  Human virtues prevailing
  'Gainst corruption so rife;
  In this wickedness concerted,
  In this age perverse, perverted,
  The humanity of Jesus
  Must the church now display.--------1173
Grant us the vision clear to see
We need a new humanity;
From all our nature, we must be free;
Eating of Jesus is the key!

  Breathing this man within the Word,
  Calling with them who call "O Lord";
  Eating this man in one accord
  Breathe, call and eat!

Our flesh for building is no good;
God's house must have acacia wood!
Christ's human life is balanced and fine,
And it's adorned with gold divine.

  We want to stand as boards so strong,
  Held by the bars where we belong;
  To be the church for which You long
  One full-grown man!

Satan's one aim: to ruin man,
Man, who's the center of God's plan!
But man will rule the earth utterly,
Conquering every enemy.

  Each time we turn and eat this man
  We put an end to Satan's plan.
  Jesus through His humanity
  Has conquered all!--------1174
What a victory! What a triumph!
God Himself became a man,
Clothed Himself in human nature
To fulfill His mighty plan.
He through death destroyed the devil;
Risen now, the Son of Man!

Jesus by His human virtues
Did the subtle one arrest;
He as man withstood the tempter,
Fully passed through every test.
Now in spirit I can take Him,
All His virtues to possess.

In the Spirit of this Jesus
Is His human life so fine.
Human virtues have been added
To the Spirit all divine.
What abundance in this Spirit,
Rich supply for all mankind!

How mysterious! Yet how real!
Such a man now lives in me.
Into all my heart He's spreading
He, my human life, to be.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I will praise unceasingly.

Oh, what wonder! Oh, how glorious!
God in flesh is manifest.
We the members of His Body
His humanity express.
For the building of God's dwelling
We His human life possess.--------1175
Ephesians 1:19-23

Power, exceeding great pow'r is to us,
To us who believe, us who receive!
Power that raised Christ, yes, pow'r glorious

  There is pow'r, pow'r, overruling pow'r,
  To the church, to the church!
  There is pow'r, pow'r, overruling pow'r,
  Given to His Body, the church!--------1176
Ephesians 1:19-23

Pow'r exceeding great God did demonstrate
When He raised His Son from the dead.
May this pow'r we see, with it strengthened be,
And in resurrection life be led.

  Power, power, resurrection power,
  Energize us mightily within!
  Power, power, resurrection power,
  Energize us in the inner man!

Pow'r exceeding high God did magnify
When He raised His Son far above all.
Principalities, pow'rs, and majesties
At the name of Jesus Christ must fall.

  Power, power, all-transcending power,
  Elevate us mightily within!
  Power, power, all-transcending power,
  Elevate us in the inner man!

Pow'r surpassing too, all things to subdue
Has been given to Christ, pow'r complete.
We His Body are; so, hallelujah,
Everything must be beneath our feet!

  Power, power, all-subduing power,
  All-subjecting mightily within!
  Power, power, all-subduing power,
  All-subjecting to the inner man!

And the best of all, overruling all,
O'er all to the church Christ is Head.
Pow'r so glorious over all's to us;
To the highest place the church is led.

  Power, power, overruling power,
  Ruling over all, without, within!
  Power, power, overruling power,
  Ruling, reigning, through the inner man!--------1177
Oh, Christ in all His glory put on humanity
So He could be my Person, and live instead of me.
A man in life and being, He fully fits my case,
So all His glorious Person can me replace.

  O Lord, O Lord, You are the man for me!
  I take You as my Person, as my full identity.
  O Lord, O Lord, subdue my every part,
  And every moment, every place, make home in all my heart.

Oh, Christ became the Spirit to speak inside of me,
And as the speaking Spirit He speaks unceasingly.
His speaking is the water that washes me within,
Discharging all my oldness, imparting Him.

  O Lord, O Lord, speak all You want to me.
  Your speaking is Your presence  I must have it constantly.
  O Lord, O Lord, speak-wash my every part
  And by this metabolic change, make home in all my heart.

Oh, Christ will come, the Bridegroom, for us, His glorious Bride,
By coming from within us the church is glorified.
His Person is the glory expanding now in us;
This glory is our Person  how glorious!

  O Lord, O Lord, by Your economy
  So flood us with Your glory, saturate us thoroughly.
  Come out, come out, break forth in glory here,
  And from the church, O glorious One, in glory soon appear.--------1178
We have seen Christ is reality:
But it's not sufficient just to see:
He in our experience must be
Everything to us.
We in prayer behold Him face to face,
In the Word and meetings know His grace;
But in daily life, in every place,
What is He to us?

  Hallelujah! By His light we see
  Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be
  If we'll only turn to Him at every time, in every day,
  Every thing, in every way and
  Be specific for reality!
  And be done with generality!
  If we'll just apply Him, we will see
  He's everything to us.

Life is full of opportunities
Ordered by our Father's hand: we see
Everything's the best that it could be,
So let's gain Christ!
Christ our content and reality
To shine out from us unceasingly:
He must have a way in you and me,
He must have a way.

  Hallelujah! In the body we
  Bear the death of Christ continually:
  Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
  The outer man is broken down,
  The inner man is shining so that
  In these earthen vessels men can see
  There's the treasure of reality!
  Thus the gospel's glorious light will be
  Shining out from us.

  Not just doctrines and theology,
  But the content of reality:
  Christ as everything in you and me
  He's everything to us!--------1179
My old man has been crucified with Him,
With all its foul corruption deep within;
And buried too its nature serpentine,
Completely finished  this great fact is mine,
I hold it fast.

But there's a Person in my spirit now,
Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low;
Who by the Word's pure milk will grow to be
The overcoming inner man in me
To gain my heart.

Christ as my Person must possess my heart
And be preeminent in every part.
The former owner died but haunts it still.
O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will
Now welcome Thee.

In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
The human and divine in one accord;
Yet Thou must have a proper faculty
That all Thy glorious personality
May be expressed.

So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,
That it may be Thy home in every way,
A place for Thee to come and settle down,
And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
In one new man.--------1180
My old person has been nullified;
With my Lord upon the cross he died;
Now in nothing shall he be applied;
He's dead to me.
My new Person in my spirit dwells;
Springing in me as a bubbling well;
Flowing out until each part He fills
With abundant life.

  Christ, my Person, in my spirit lives;
  And my heart to Him I'd daily give;
  That my inner man could have a home
  And a place to settle down, yes,
  A place to call His own, and
  There be my complete reality,
  There expressing all He is to me,
  Living in my heart abundantly
  As my Person real.

By this Person being formed in me,
I'll a member of His Body be,
No more acting individually,
But with the saints.
More and more our Person He must be;
That our natural personality
Be eliminated thoroughly
Till Christ is all.

  Only Christ, our Person, must remain;
  From our aims, our goals we must refrain,
  Till the church be only Christ Himself
  Built up as the one new man,
  Thus fulfilling God's great plan of
  Mingling fully with the human race
  To obtain a proper dwelling place,
  'Stablishing His kingdom's rule and grace;
  Over all the earth.

  Not Himself just individually,
  But the church together corporately,
  Taking Christ as all in all, to be
  The full-grown, perfect man.--------1181
Lord, to know Thee as our Person,
Earnestly we seek and pray;
To experience Thy fulness
In a constant inner way.
Never longer only outward
Or with soulish thoughts obsessed,
But, O Lord, in realest contact
We by Thee would be possessed.

  Lord, Thou art our Person,
  In our inmost being,
  May we constantly experience
  This reality.

All the world is under darkness,
Driven by the fallen soul,
And the enemy designing
Does the soulish life control.
Such we were till God, through mercy,
Caused His Son to dwell in us;
Now we fully come to know Him
In His church so glorious.

  Lord, Thou art our Person,
  In our inmost being,
  May we constantly experience
  This reality.

Once we walked a soulish person,
Wandering in the wilderness,
Never knowing that our spirit
Craved God's fullness to express;
At the moment Jesus entered
Instantly the whole was changed.
Now we're people spirit-centered!
Hallelujah! Rearranged!

  Lord, Thou art our Person,
  In our inmost being,
  May we constantly experience
  This reality.

Now our spirit is our person
What a glorious fact is this!
Christ Himself in us expressing
God's intent and holiness.
Not the soul-life's vain delusion,
But the spirit strengthened is;
Christ Himself is now our Person
He is ours and we are His.

  Lord, Thou art our Person,
  In our inmost being,
  May we constantly experience
  This reality.--------1182
In spirit and reality
We meet to worship Thee,
And every principality
Must fall down or must flee.
Reality, reality,
O what a joy to see,
That Christ may be enjoyed by us
As our reality.

A Person, Thou hast come in us,
Into our spirit now,
And quickened us until we know
Our inner man art Thou.
O praise Thee, Lord, we sense Thee thus,
Forever inwardly;
Thy Person in each one of us
Is our reality.

And now the corporate life we live
Christ in His Body known;
Where every portion adds more Christ,
Until the whole is shown.
O Hallelujah, one new man!
Our portions blend as one;
In one accord, express the Lord,
And He will quickly come.--------1183
Revelation 1:9-20

On the Lord's day, John, in spirit,
Heard a voice and turned and saw
Seven lampstands brightly shining;
Of pure gold, divine, they were.
In the midst of them, appearing,
He beheld the Son of Man,
Ever for the churches caring,
Tending God's eternal plan.

His appearance, lo, how different
From the One John knew before.
Now He's girt in golden raiment,
Not the robe which then He wore.
Girt about the breasts and serving,
He the priesthood fully bears;
Cherishing the lampstands dearly,
He for all the churches cares.

Ancient One He is, yet fresher
Than the newly driven snow;
Eyes are as a flaming fire,
Feet as burnished brass aglow.
Tender eyes that gazed at Peter,
Now are as a burning flame;
And the voice that whispered, "Mary,"
Many waters now became.

John, once formerly reclining
On His breast, now fell as dead,
When he saw Him thus in spirit,
As He is, exhibited.
Lo, the Christ of Revelation!
See Him, thus intensified,
That the lampstands, His expression,
May be strengthened and supplied.--------1184
Revelation 1

In Revelation chapter one
God gives a vision of the Son,
Of Him who was and is to come;
Oh, let us to this One now come.

In spirit hear His trumpet voice;
We must be turned to see His choice
The seven lampstands golden fair;
The Son of Man is walking there.

The great high priestly robe He wears,
For every church He fully cares:
He trims the lamp, the oil supplies;
He makes them burn, flames in His eyes.

A golden girdle on His breast
His work is done, and from His rest
He unto all the churches pours
Himself in love, the treasure store.

His head, His hair is white as wool
The ancient One with youth is full.
His face is shining as the sun
To burn and lighten every one.

Oh, when this living One we see,
We'll fall as dead, we'll finished be.
But then the Lord His comfort gives
He once was dead, but now He lives.

Let every church just love Him more
His riches then He will outpour.
All others loves now lay aside;
Let's take this Jesus, none beside.--------1185
John 5:1-9

In the multitude he lay there
With a sickness many years;
Impotent and lying helpless,
Every fraught with many fears.
Waiting for the water's moving,
Waiting for the angel's stir;
Powerless to move, however,
Helpless, hopeless, lying there.

At this pool how clear the picture
Of the hopeless case of all
Who are seeking self-perfection
To recover from the fall.
Though the law is good and holy,
Flesh, to keep the law, is dead;
What we need is not religion,
But the Word of life instead.

Though it's feast day, he's not happy,
Though the Sabbath, there's no rest;
Lying in his poor condition,
Miserable and sore depressed.
At that moment Jesus saw him,
Knowing he was thus so long.
"Will you be made whole?" He asked him,
"Healed and walking, well and strong?'

Though he told his hopeless story,
Scarce believing what he'd heard,
Yet, soon to his feet arising,
He received the living word.
This is all our situation,
We  like him  were lying there
In the sheep-fold of religion,
Under law's prevailing care.

While we yet were weak and helpless,
Christ the Son of God did come.
By His word we're now enlivened;
He's the life-imparting One!
Hallelujah for this Jesus,
He's the Word of life to men;
For law's bondage He releases,
Death is turned to life again!--------1186
John 1:19-36

The scribes and Pharisees all thought
A leader great would come.
So they to John the Baptist came
To ask if he's the One.
"Art thou the Coming One?' they asked,
To which he made reply:
"I'm not the Christ  I am not He
A voice, that's all, am I."

And on the morrow, John stood there
And spoke to two or three.
And as he lifted up his eyes,
He then did Jesus see.
He said, "Behold the Lamb of God,
'Tis He Who walks this way.
He's here to take the sins of all
And bear them all away!"

Yet poor religion counted not
These things of any worth,
But seeking for a leader great
It lingered on in dearth;
And looking for a movement strong,
Continued in its strife.
Preoccupied with these things,
They missed the Lord of LIFE!

Religion is Christ's enemy,
It's even so today.
For though they name Him, should He come,
They'd put the Lord away.
They did it then, they'd do it now,
They'd miss the Lord again.
So let us seek the Lord Himself,
The lamb, the dove obtain.

Now in the Lord's recovery
We're drawn to Christ alone.
The Spirit as the gentle dove
Has found in us a home.
Let all religion turn away
To movements wide and great;
This testimony of Himself
Our Lord will vindicate!--------1187
Hebrews 8

Your ministry, O Lord,
How excellent it is;
A better covenant,
And better promises;
Enacted on a better law.
Of such You are Executor.

A better covenant,
And better promises;
A better law of life
And sacrifice this is.
Redemption's work, done long ago,
A better blood has made it so.

In Hebrews eight we see
The way to make us whole;
Life planted deep within,
Which spreads into the soul.
The law of life, imparted, still
Inscribed in mind, emotion, will.

The law of letters leave,
The law of life pursue;
The one is old and dead,
The other fresh and new.
Dead teachings cannot help the seed;
The law of life is what we need.

The law of life in us,
In function now we see,
Works not by will and thought
But automatically.
It saturates, conforms to Him;
The standard model spreads within.

Our sins are all forgiv'n,
His life imparted too;
God is our God today,
And we're His people true.
We know Him in an inward way:
These blessings four have come to stay.

We're being sonized now;
The life within will do
The deep transforming work
Of making us anew.
In ages past, the work was done
Now prayer is over  praise the Son!--------1188
Hebrews 8

Upon the throne of Jesus Christ
We've taken up our seat.
The world and Satan, sin and self
Are all beneath our feet!
Christ's finished work did put us here,
When once for all He died;
No more are we the sinners poor,
We're fully glorified.

We're dwelling in the house of God,
The church life glorious.
The shrinking-back, low Christian life,
Is not the life for us!
We're passing through the Holy Place
Of mind, emotion, will;
We're dwelling in the Holiest
Where God our being fills.

We're under the New Covenant,
With glorious items, three:
The law of life, spontaneous,
Transforming utterly;
We are His people, He's our God
Oh, bless'd reality;
We all are fully able now
To know God inwardly.

A supplement God added then;
This item we must know:
Christ Jesus did put sin away
Two thousand years ago.
No memory of sin at all,
It's hist'ry, done and gone;
In spirit now the law of life
Will take us swiftly on.

Two things accomplished by our Lord
On Calvary's cross, we see:
The law of life, the end of sin!
Our God's economy.
Since all His work was finished there,
He entered into rest;
Now on the throne He prays that we
Will take our full bequest.

We'll drop our former concepts, Lord,
To take this finished way;
Appropriating each bequest,
We'll praise You more each day.
We'll heed our High Priest's inward call
"Come forward!" to the end
Until we reach the final goal;
The New Jerusalem!--------1189
Son of Man, Son of Man on the throne today;
Son of Man, Pioneer, He has led the way;
Following, how we sing, Jesus leads us on;
We are marching with the Victor to the throne.

On we go, on we go to the throne with Him;
On we go, through this age, age so dark and grim;
Then shall we  formerly, Satan's captured ones
Be exalted with the Lord upon His throne.

Called as sons, called as sons, destined to be kings;
Called as sons, we've no time for the worldly things:
Yet we know, it is so  we don't qualify!
Thus the Lord must search and burn and purify.

Search and burn, search and burn all our inward parts;
Search and burn, thoroughly, to refine our hearts;
We'll not fear, but be clear  burning, searching thus
Is the gracious visit of the Lord to us.

With the Man, with the Man is a rainbow fair;
Glorious bow, 'round the throne, faithfulness declares:
We deserved to be served with God's judgment sore.
But we have been spared to praise Him more and more.--------1190
Genesis 12

O Lord, You've called to us, and Canaan we would win,
To be Your corporate man and dwell with You therein;
But how the darkness of this world does hold us in
O Lord, appear to us, we pray.

  O Lord, appear to us today;
  We see this is the only way.
  The idols to forsake
  And Canaan land partake,
  O Lord, appear to us today.

O God of glory, shine; draw and we'll follow You.
Our strength and motive be, it's nothing we could do.
Your light attracts us, Lord, 'til all else fades from view
O Lord, do shine on us, we pray.

  O Lord, do shine on us today;
  Till all our background fades away,
  Till You alone we see,
  Shining so gloriously
  O Lord, do shine on us today.

In Your appearing, Lord, we have Your speaking clear;
Your word empowers us and drives away all fear.
So, Lord, keep calling us, Your voice we need to hear.
O Lord, do speak to us, we pray.

  O Lord, do speak in us today;
  You know the words You need to say.
  To open all our heart,
  Your very Self impart.
  O Lord, do speak in us today.

O Lord, it's not of us, we've seen it's all of You;
You are the calling One, Originator too!
We can receive this call by our beholding You
O God of glory, come, we pray.

  O God of glory, come today;
  We've seen this is the only way
  To answer Your dear call
  That You might be our all
  O God of glory, come today.--------1191
From my spirit within flows a fountain of life
The Triune God flowing in me;
God the Father's the source,
Christ the Son is the course,
And the Spirit imparts life to me.

  Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,
  And my soul-life at last I lay down;
  O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;
  At Your coming may life be my crown.

In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;
He leads me by waters of rest;
No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;
In the flow I am perfectly blessed.

  Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,
  And my soul-life at last I lay down;
  O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;
  At Your coming may life be my crown.

Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,
To live in His presence divine;
Hallelujah, I've heard an encouraging word:
"Abide  you're a branch in the vine."

  Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,
  And my soul-life at last I lay down;
  O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;
  At Your coming may life be my crown.--------1192
Genesis 1

Chapter one of Genesis:
Life is God's one emphasis,
Showing Christ subjectively,
Step by step He grows in me.

Just as earth became a waste,
Death and darkness once I faced.
God had judged, no light did shine;
Hollowness and void were mine.

Satan's fall had filled the seas
With corruption, sin, disease.
Yet the Spirit brooded o'er
The abyss: chaos no more!

God then spoke: the air was cleared!
Darkness which I once had feared
Was dispelled by God's own light.
A new day! No longer night!

As the light began to shine
His discernment became mine.
I began to see aright;
God divided dark from light.

Then the waters He did split;
An expanse between them fit,
Earthly things from heavenly,
Separated hence they'd be.

On the third day God designed
That the waters be confined.
In our lives dry land must be;
No more death and no more sea!

God commands: death's water halt!
Christ, the good land, we exalt!
Separated from all strife
We enjoy Christ as our life.

Growing in us inwardly;
Grass, then herb, then fruitful tree.
We begin as but a blade;
Soon our being He'll pervade.

10 Then the fourth day lights He set;
Bearers these, more definite.
Richer light to radiate,
Higher life to generate.

11 Sun, the greater light we see
Ruling day triumphantly;
Yet when darkness fills the skies,
Waxing moon is on the rise!

12 'Tis the Church she typifies;
For her light on Christ relies.
In His image meant to be,
She reflects Christ perfectly.

13 Lastly, precious stars He placed,
Strong in spirit, full of grace;
Shining when the moon seems faint,
These are overcoming saints.

14 What a glorious picture here:
Sun and moon and stars appear!
Lord, our prayer is that we'd be
Full of light and life in Thee.--------1193
Life is God the Father in Christ Jesus
As the Spirit flowing into us.
How enjoyable, this Person wonderful!
He's our life so rich and bountiful.

We experienced regeneration
When we opened to this living One.
We were born again; another life came in.
Now it floods us till we're full of Him.

He within us is the living Spirit
In our spirit, flowing out of it
Into all our heart, transforming every part
By the life which He Himself imparts.

Now He must have our cooperation.
We must set our mind upon the Son.
We must turn away from all that leads astray,
Till our mind is set on Him each day.

Lord, our human spirit now contains You.
Still Your purpose in us You would do;
If our wandering mind would leave old thoughts behind,
Then Your life and peace in it we'll find.

Lord, we would our every thought be captured
By the rich enjoyment in Your Word.
In it we're supplied, our mind there will abide,
Till our thoughts are wholly sanctified.

Let's keep practicing the application
Of this life by minding just the Son.
Praise Him for the way to live by Him today!
Lord, on You our minds will ever stay.--------1194
There are two lines to live by in our living today
One the life line to bring us into Christ all the way.
But the other is knowledge which will make us die;
We must be very careful on which line we abide.

  Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
  We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
  Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
  Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.

Lord, we would be as Abel, fully contacting You;
Not by knowledge or concept, but by life fresh and new.
Just as Enosh began to call upon Your name,
And as Enoch who walked with You, we'll do just the same.

  Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
  We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
  Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
  Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.

Keep us living and walking as did old Abraham;
In Your holy appearing to be transfused like him.
As did Isaac and Jacob, Moses lived this way
So dependent upon Your presence with him each day.

  Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
  We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
  Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
  Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.

Full enjoyment had David, ate the life-giving tree.
Daniel prayed to his God and lived by Him constantly.
Jesus lived by the Father to be life complete;
Now as His living Body of the life tree we'll eat.

  Oh, we'll stay on God's life line, never turning aside.
  We don't care for vain knowledge, which will cause us to die.
  Lord, we'll touch You by calling on Your name each day;
  Living in Your appearing, in Your presence we'll stay.--------1195
Life is mysterious, life is God Himself,
Whose whole intention focuses on man.
God made him to take in the tree of life,
To have a man of life for His own plan.

But man was tempted and seduced to sin,
By taking knowledge from the other source.
This man then fell as knowledge entered in
And dominated him with all its force.

This knowledge has developed in the man
Into the human culture on the earth.
So man, created to fulfill God's plan,
Became a failure full of Satan's dearth.

Then God came in the Person of the Son;
Lived He on earth, Christ Jesus was His name
A living model so that everyone
Could live by life, God's fullness to obtain.

This God-man, Christ, went to the cross and died,
By death He ended knowledge, the old man.
Things negative forever crucified,
Death He subdued, a new life He began!

From death He resurrected and became
The living Spirit to give life to us.
When we believe and call upon His name;
This living Spirit comes to dwell in us.

By this the very Triune God is now
The living Spirit mingling deep within.
Our spirit joins in oneness; this is how
We are one spirit evermore with Him.

'Tis by this Spirit that we walk and act,
We have our being, think, and see all things;
We're now within this Spirit! What a fact!
This Spirit to us all God's fullness brings!

So now we have to set our mind on Him;
Each day, each hour, our mind on Him must be;
That by this Spirit we'd be saved within
By life and reign in life eternally.

10 'Tis by this Spirit that we shall be freed
From Sin whose law inside us death would bring.
Our mortal bodies will have life indeed;
Thus sanctified we'll be in everything.

11 This Spirit shall transform our natural life,
Save us from self, build us in one new man,
Till we're conformed to be like Jesus Christ,
Thus finishing our God's eternal plan.

12 Life is our God and life is Christ our Lord.
Life is the Spirit. Life's the only way
Till we're transfigured and redeemed to God.
We're waiting, looking forward to that day!--------1196
Our God is living  say, Hallelujah!
He's living in us  say, Hallelujah!
We taste His riches,
He is our portion.
Just say 'O Lord' to taste and see.

We come together  there's nothing better
For in the Spirit we are His family;
His living Body!
We just express Him.
Jesus is our reality.

In all the churches we're being filled now
For the saturation throughout the nation,
To spread our Jesus
To every city
This land will see the living Christ.--------1197
1 John 1:5-7

God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all!
Oh, how we love within His presence to dwell!
In this light we enjoy a constant cleansing within
From every sin!

  Sisters: In the light,
  Brothers: We are walking
  Sisters: Fellowship,
  Brothers: We're enjoying;
  Sisters: And the blood
  Brothers: Of God's Son
  Everyone: Is cleansing us from sin.

  Sisters: We confess,
  Brothers: He is faithful
  Sisters: To forgive
  Brothers: He is righteous.
  Sisters: What a joy!
  Brothers: We are cleansed
  Everyone: From every sin!--------1198
A mighty flowing-out is God,
He flows throughout the ages.
And so to flow Himself to man
He is in many stages;
Yet still one God is He,
One flow eternally;
His stages pave the way
To flow through man today,
And now He flows within us!

In the beginning we can see,
God as a flowing river,
The river to convey the tree,
Himself as life deliver.
And at the end the same,
The river doth remain,
God in the Lamb doth flow,
The tree prevails to grow,
And God flows on forever.

God flowed Himself into a man,
The man we call Christ Jesus.
He gave up His own life for man
And God's own life releases.
Though Satan did his best
To put God's flow to rest
He had Him crucified
And cruelly pierced His side
But out came blood and water!

The blood and water flowed from Him,
In streams of pure salvation.
The blood brings cleansing from all sin;
Water, regeneration.
And now the Spirit flows,
Brings God where'er He goes.
All he could do, the foe,
Was just release the flow.
And God just keeps on flowing.--------1199
God's intention in this universe is with humanity,
So the Lord became the Spirit just with man to mingled be.
We rejoice that we can all partake of His economy.
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!

In the center of our being, past our mind, emotion, will,
Is a certain spot created to contain the Lord until
By His flowing and His flooding He will all our being fill;
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!

Now within the Lord's recov'ry, we're so glad to find the way
To experience the Triune God and live by Him today
Get into the mingled spirit, and within the spirit stay;
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!

In the midst of seven lampstands, now the Son of Man we see;
Eyes ablaze and feet a'burning, He's for God's recovery.
God's intention He's accomplishing  a corporate entity;
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!

In our daily life and all we are and do and think and say,
How we need a deeper mingling just to gain the Lord each day;
Lord, we give ourselves completely just to take the mingled way.
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!

From the fruit of daily living, New Jerusalem we'll see,
It's the ultimate in mingling  it's divine humanity.
And what joy that we can share it all, and share it corporately.
Yes, mingling is the way.

  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
  Yes, mingling is the way!--------1200
Ezekiel 1:4

There's a stormy wind a-blowing from the north;
Let it blow! Let it blow!
God as our exp'rience will the wind bring forth;
Let it blow! Let it blow!

  Let it blow! the rushing mighty wind;
  Let it blow us into life!
  Let it blow! the gracious wind of God;
  Let it blow us into Christ!

There's a hov'ring cloud a-following the wind,
Covering us! Covering us!
And the presence of the Lord the cloud does bring,
Covering us! Covering us!

  Covering us, God's overshadowing cloud
  God has come to stay with us.
  Covering us, the gracious cloud of God
  Strength and comfort glorious!

With the cloud continually a fire does flash
Burning us! Burning us!
It exposes sin, the soul life, and the flesh,
Burning us! Burning us!

  Let it burn! the jealous flame of God;
  Let it burn continually!
  Let it burn! this all-consuming flame;
  Let it burn us thoroughly!

Then from out the fire does the electrum glow,
Shining forth! Shining forth!
The redeeming God does our experience show,
Shining forth! Shining forth!

  Let Him shine! This gold and silver One;
  Let Him shine for all to see!
  'Tis the Lamb-God who has now become
  Our enjoyment inwardly.

Let the wind, cloud, fire and th' electrum be
Wrought in us, o'er and o'er;
Let this cycle be repeated constantly
More and more, more and more!

  Blow and hover, burn and shine forth, Lord,
  All our being to possess,
  That we all may gain Thee constantly
  All Thy likeness to express.--------1201
Ezekiel 1:4-10

From the north where God is dwelling
Comes a rushing, stormy gale.
Now the mighty Spirit blowing
All our being does assail.
We are stirred to our foundations
How this wind awakens us!
Thus we're open for God's dealings,
And the cloud descends on us.

With the cloud we have His presence
Sweetly hov'ring over us;
So enveloped by His nearness;
In the Lord we put our trust.
But the cloud brings with it fire
To consume our selfish lusts;
That as ashes something higher
May be added into us.

Then from out the flashing fire
Comes th' electrum glowing bright.
God as gold and man as silver
Now are mingled. What a sight!
This bright metal, O Lord Jesus,
Is Thyself, Lamb-God sublime.
O Lord, work Thyself within us
Till th' electrum in us shines.

By our passing through this cycle,
Living creatures we become
To express the life of Jesus;
He with whom we've been made one.
We express Him as a human,
As a man so good and fine;
Balanced, normal, never striving;
Fully human, yet divine.

We express Him as a lion
Conquering every enemy;
As an ox obedient, lowly,
Faithful in His ministry.
We express Him as an eagle,
So transcendent, soaring high;
Never held by fear or flatter,
He above it all does fly.

Hallelujah! What a figure
Of the way God deals with us!
From the wind, cloud, fire, electrum,
To the creatures glorious:
As the man, the ox and lion,
As the eagle  all the four
Will be our complete expression
As we eat Him more and more.--------1202
God in His justifying has a plan,
A deeper purpose for a corporate man.
When we were called, this mighty Lord of all
Appeared to us to save us from the fall.

We walked as strangers unaware of Him,
But in His glory God shined deep within,
Infusing His own element in us;
This precious essence was our Lord Jesus.

What glory! How attractive was this light!
How we appreciated such a sight!
Our first reaction was belief in Him
This precious God has placed Himself within.

Our first reflection of this element
Reflected Jesus back to God, Who sent
His own response to count as righteousness
Our faith in Him Who was infused in us.

But we would hold to this reality,
Our Jesus Christ in us our all to be,
Enjoying all He is abundantly,
Content to have this One eternally.

Thus God could never be so satisfied;
Knowing that we cared only to abide
In our experiences of His Son,
Not caring for His goal to make us one.

Still He would seek those faithful saints who'd hear
His call to give up everything so dear,
To offer up their individual Christ;
To come together for the Body life.--------1203
  Romans

God is righteous in His doings,
He is perfect in His ways;
Just is He in all His actions,
And He well deserves our praise.
Righteous was His condemnation,
Righteous His requirement;
For the law had deemed us sinners,
And for judgment we were meant.

Oh, how blest the love that spared us,
For the law had judged us dead.
God, to meet the righteous judgment,
Passed it on His Son instead.
Hallelujah! Our Redeemer,
Christ, to God has purchased us;
Now enjoying His redemption,
We become God's righteousness.

God is holy in His nature,
Holiness is what He is.
In this way He sanctified us,
Makes our nature one with His.
Spreading from our quickened spirit,
He renews each inward part,
Moving into all our being,
Making home in all our heart.

Oh, how blessed is this process!
It's the Lord's life-saving way.
It's our constant, real experience;
It's our life from day to day.
As we're minding just the spirit,
Then the mind is life to us,
And the Lord in us is gaining
Transformation marvelous!

Glory is God's true expression,
All He is, in full, expressed;
Final stage of our redemption,
Bodily made manifest.
Glory is the consummation
Of this life which sanctifies;
Our complete transfiguration
Is the goal which life supplies.

'Tis for this we wait, expecting
To be raptured, glorified.
Then the earth will see God's fullness;
Christ completely testified.
We fore'er will just express Him,
Nature will rejoice to see
All the sons of God in glory
Manifested finally.

By His mercy, we're selected,
Ours a glorious destiny.
Not by running, nor by willing,
But through God's own sovereignty.
Once we were wild olive branches,
Now the root and fat partake,
Grafted in, rejoice together,
Growing for the kingdom's sake.

As we're daily in this process
And by life are sanctified,
How we thank Him for the blessing
Of the church life He's supplied.
Here God is our full enjoyment,
Practical and real to us;
Sons we are, and heirs together,
In the church life, glorious!--------1204
The cross  we all were there,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
For all that death did share!
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
God there upon it died,
And man and all beside
Were wholly crucified
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for the cross!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  It shall never suffer loss!

The cross, it holdeth fast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
All things upon it cast,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Two arms extended strong
Hold those who there belong;
We're through with self  our song:
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for the cross!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  It shall never suffer loss!

'Tis there man died in God,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
There ceased this human clod,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
With joy we all declare,
We're terminated there!
We'll sing now and fore'er,
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for the cross!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  It shall never suffer loss!

'Tis there man died in God,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Fulfilling thus His plan,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Through death He was released
And now He has increased;
His life is our rich feast
Hallelujah for the cross!

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah for the cross!
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  It shall never suffer loss!--------1205
Philippians 3:10-14

Press on, press on toward the goal
The all-inclusive Christ.
To gain the prize of God's high call,
Press on, press on to Christ!

  Pressing on! Pressing on!
  Pressing on! Hallelujah for the prize
  We're pressing on! On and on!
  To gain the Christ of God!

Press on, press on, count all things loss,
All that is gain to us,
To win the prize, the Christ of God,
Is far more glorious!

  Pressing on! Pressing on!
  Pressing on! Hallelujah for the prize
  We're pressing on! On and on!
  To gain the Christ of God!

Press on, press on to know the Lord
And resurrection power
Oh, this is our supreme reward,
E'en in the suffering hour!

  Pressing on! Pressing on!
  Pressing on! Hallelujah for the prize
  We're pressing on! On and on!
  To gain the Christ of God!

Press on, press on, this one thing do,
Forget the things behind;
Press onward to the Christ before,
Press onward with this mind!

  Pressing on! Pressing on!
  Pressing on! Hallelujah for the prize
  We're pressing on! On and on!
  To gain the Christ of God!--------1206
Hebrews 12:1-2

There's a race for us to run  Hallelujah,
And a way for us to race to win.
To all those who have begun  Hallelujah,
God has spoken, "Look away to Him!"

  Look away! O look away!
  Look to Jesus now today!
  Look away from everything unto Jesus,
  Look away from everything to Him!

Look away from all around  Hallelujah,
Look away from all the strife and din;
Look away where peace is found  Hallelujah,
Look away from everything to Him.

  Look away! O look away!
  Look to Jesus now today!
  Look away from everything unto Jesus,
  Look away from everything to Him!

Look away from fickle soul  Hallelujah,
Look away from failing self within;
Look away toward the goal  Hallelujah,
Look away from everything to Him.

  Look away! O look away!
  Look to Jesus now today!
  Look away from everything unto Jesus,
  Look away from everything to Him!

Look away from all the past  Hallelujah,
Look away from both the good and sin;
To the living One hold fast  Hallelujah,
Look away from everything to Him.

  Look away! O look away!
  Look to Jesus now today!
  Look away from everything unto Jesus,
  Look away from everything to Him!

Look away into His face  Hallelujah,
He who'll finish what He did begin.
O what grace to run the race  Hallelujah
We obtain by looking off to Him!

  Look away! O look away!
  Look to Jesus now today!
  Look away from everything unto Jesus,
  Look away from everything to Him!--------1207
Hebrews 12:1-2

There's a way before us and a race to run
Christ our way, Christ our way!
Turn away from everything distracting us
Run the race, run the race!
From the altar through the Holy Place,
Through the veil into our God,
To the law of life within the ark;
'Tis the goal, our great reward.

There's a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
Urging us, forward come!
There is Abel, Enoch, Jacob, Abraham,
Moses, David, Solomon.
John the Baptist greater than them all,
Even he bids forward come!
These all died in faith, receiving not
Promises that were to come.

The Old Testament believers give the call,
"Forward come, forward come!"
For complete perfection they depend on us
Going on! Going on!
We are at the consummation now
Of our God's economy;
Better things we are experiencing.
Praise the Lord  reality!

E'en the least of us is greater than their great.
We're not small, we're not small!
They are waiting, watching, and expecting us.
"Forward come!" hear their call!
They have run the race and for their sakes
We'll obey the law of life.
Till the day we'll all be joined in one
To express God's glorious Christ.--------1208
Years I spent in sorrow 'round the cross,
Still repenting over sins and dross.
Then at last the river I did cross,
To touch the throne.

  Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace
  That I find of Him to run the race!
  Boldly now I come again to taste
  My glorious Lord.

In my Christian life I'd daily fall,
So I answered every altar-call,
Till I left the altar, left it all,
To touch the throne.

  Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace
  That I find of Him to run the race!
  Boldly now I come again to taste
  My glorious Lord.

Brothers, to the Holiest forward come;
Leave your sins behind, the race now run.
Hallelujah! All the work is done
The veil is gone!

  Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace
  That I find of Him to run the race!
  Boldly now I come again to taste
  My glorious Lord.

Now within the veil, enjoying God,
Manna, law of life, and budding rod;
Christ Himself, the ark, is our abode
Hallelujah!

  Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace
  That I find of Him to run the race!
  Boldly now I come again to taste
  My glorious Lord.--------1209
Praise God for tidings glad
We're at the throne of grace;
Our gospel's not so low,
We're in the highest place.
We're meeting here around the throne,
Enjoying God with all His own.

Start in the outer court,
But aim to get inside;
The Holy Place is good,
But do not there abide.
Leave sin behind  it's put away;
We're in the veil with God to stay.

To rise from earth to heav'n,
A deeper turn we need;
To be where Christ is now
Upon the throne indeed.
We're gathered at the throne of grace,
Beholding Jesus face to face.

We're being turned as one,
Not individually;
Not private Christians now.
But Body Christians we.
As members here in one accord,
We are the Body of the Lord.

As Body Christians now
We have a higher word.
Foundation's word we see,
'Tis altar, cross, and blood.
Perfection's word is little known,
'Tis fellowship around the throne.

Christ is objective too,
But subjective are we
In our experience;
Our spirit is the key.
God, throne, and holiest  we see
Our spirit now contains all three.

Leviticus is past,
And Aaron's work is o'er;
Melchisedec is here,
High Priest forevermore;
His ministry is now so fine:
He comes to feed us bread and wine.--------1210
Romans 8:17-39

Through God's word, my hope at His returning
Is that all my being be redeemed;
Yet in times of grief and tribulation,
Doubt and fear arise, no hope is seen.
In those hours, when prayer cannot be uttered,
Only groaning from my breast is heard.
Then the Spirit, in like manner, helps me,
Praying in my weakness unto God.

Lord, my prayer is not for deeper suffering,
But that from each trial I'd be free.
Let the cup of bitterness be taken;
Yet, Thy will, not mine, dear Lord, must be.
Even now, though trials sore surround me,
Still within my heart there is a peace,
For the love of God outpoured within me
Floods my heart and bids my doubting cease.

Blest assurance! God has fully ordered
Every matter by His sovereign hand;
Every person (though we see so dimly),
Every thing's according to His plan.
Every trial is but the Father's answer
To the groaning of the Spirit's prayer;
May He gain in every tribulation,
Until we Christ's glory fully share.

How could God from all His dealings spare us,
After He spared not His only Son?
Could the Potter's hand upon the vessel
Ever leave the shaping work undone?
For the center of God's heart's desire
Is that many brethren we will be
Unto Christ, His precious First-begotten,
And to Him, conformed we'll fully be.

Heirs of God! Joint-heirs with our Lord Jesus!
What a hope of glory this for us!
Though the suff'rings presently seem grievous,
Greater far the glory then for us!
Yea, in all these things we more than conquer,
Through the One whose love has us possessed;
Soon the day for which waits all creation,
When the sons of God are manifest!--------1211
2 Peter 1:3-11

Given us, given us, God has given us
Precious faith, power divine, greatest promises.
We believed, we received, now we have all three;
By these we may grow unto maturity.

Precious faith in each saint, precious equally,
Precious faith holding us, holding ceaselessly.
Disagree or agree, still it holds us fast,
Day by day, eternally this faith shall last.

Power divine wrought in us is the source so great;
Power divine is in us now to operate.
Hence will spring everything for our life within
And for godliness without, expressing Him.

Promises, promises, all God's called ones share;
Promises, given us, great and precious are.
These we take to partake of God's nature true,
Having thus escaped the world's corruption too.

Christ within, as the pow'r, in our spirit lives;
Christ without is the Word  all God's promises.
Now the key is that we daily contact both,
Calling, praying, reading to produce the growth.

Faith and pow'r, promises  these our full supply.
Diligence, diligence, let us now apply;
For if we, to these three, full attention show
From the seed of faith the fruit of love will grow.

In the growth from the seed many items come;
By this growth in the Lord fruitful we become.
For this we need to see what the Lord's begun,
Ne'er forgetful be nor blind to what He's done.

Diligence day by day will this growth insure;
Diligence thus will make our election sure.
When indeed with this seed we cooperate,
We're supplied the kingdom's entrance, rich and great.

For this growth, for this growth, Lord, ourselves we give,
By the faith, promises, and the pow'r to live.
Nothing more, nothing less, will our basis be
By Thy grace we will cooperate with Thee.--------1212
The Lord of all has shown His plan
Unto each faithful one,
Who leaves behind the worldly things
As virgins for His Son.
To be His Bride we must match Him,
Within and outwardly;
To be this one who matches Him,
Enjoy Him constantly.

Like virgins who so single are,
They love the Groom so much,
They in His presence ever stay
Lord Jesus, make us such.
Lord, make us those who are so wise,
Who gain You every day,
The wise ones who enjoy the feast,
Who all the price will pay.

The virgins are mature in life,
They grow so normally.
They daily eat and drink the Lord,
Their lot eternally.
Our need today is growth in life,
Christ's inward work indeed;
Not knowledge, teachings, gifts, nor pow'r
But life is all we need.

Lord, as the seed of life within,
Grow more in us each day;
By spreading from our deepest part,
Gain us in every way.
Lord, strengthen Thou our inner man;
Make home in all our heart.
Fill us completely with Thyself
In every inward part.--------1213

From the fountain in my heart life can flow!

  When my heart's wholly free,
  Christ can flow through me... Hallelujah!
  Life can flow, praise the Lord, life can flow!
  From the fountain in my heart life can flow!--------1215
2 Timothy 1:7

God has not giv'n us a spirit of fear
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
We have His Word  brothers, sisters, let's hear
That pow'r deep within may flow out.

  O there's pow'r, pow'r, overcoming pow'r,
  Deep within, deep within;
  O there's pow'r, pow'r, normal Christian pow'r
  In the spirit God's given us!

God has not giv'n us a wavering will
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
But one our spirit will strengthen and fill
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!

  O there's pow'r, pow'r, overcoming pow'r,
  Deep within, deep within;
  O there's pow'r, pow'r, normal Christian pow'r
  In the spirit God's given us!

God has not giv'n us emotions so weak
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
Open our hearts and in love let us speak
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!

  O there's pow'r, pow'r, overcoming pow'r,
  Deep within, deep within;
  O there's pow'r, pow'r, normal Christian pow'r
  In the spirit God's given us!

God has not giv'n us a mind that is bound
There's pow'r deep within, pow'r deep within!
But one that's healthy and perfectly sound
There's wonderful pow'r deep within!

  O there's pow'r, pow'r, overcoming pow'r,
  Deep within, deep within;
  O there's pow'r, pow'r, normal Christian pow'r
  In the spirit God's given us!--------1216
We have an inner life; that's for our daily life;
That's for the meeting life  just Christ!
We'll live the inner life; we'll have the daily life;
We'll see the meeting life  that's just the church.

Christ is our inner life; He's in our spirit now;
Not far away from us  He's right inside!
And as we turn to Him and take Him as our all
He will become in us our inner life.

Out from our inner life will come our daily life,
And all our living be filled up with Christ.
Then as we live by Him, He lives His life in us,
And He becomes to us our daily life.

The real experience of Christ in daily life,
Will fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.
Not empty forms and such, but Christ will be so much;
And we will see Him here as the meeting life.

Without the inner life there is no daily life,
There is no meeting life, there is no church!
Christ as our inner life, Christ in our daily life
Will make the meeting life new and glorious!--------1217

  Repeat the last two lines of each verse

Remove the veils, Lord, from my heart;
True revelation grant to me;
A vision clear, O Lord, impart
Of Thy recovery.

By revelation I perceive
The power that raised Christ from the dead;
When I by faith this power receive,
I to the church am led.

Thy mighty power has set me free
From all the world's distracting things;
An entrance to the local church
This mighty power brings.

Once in the local church, I need
To take Thee as my person, Lord;
My outward man each day recede,
My heart is for the Lord.

I take Thee as my person, Lord;
I have been crucified with Thee.
My inner man has been restored;
I'm now indwelt by Thee.

When all Thy members self forsake,
Thy glorious Body, Lord, is known;
When of Thy Person we partake,
The one new man is shown.

The church life is the one new man
In every local church expressed;
Thy Body is a corporate man,
One Person manifest.--------1221
John 10

Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd
Brought us right out of the fold
Into His pasture so plenteous,
Into His riches untold.

  Glorious church life,
  Feasting from such a rich store!
  Here where we're dwelling in oneness
  God commands life evermore.

In the divisions He sought us,
Weary and famished for food;
Into the good land He brought us,
Oh, to our spirit how good!

  Glorious church life,
  Feasting from such a rich store!
  Here where we're dwelling in oneness
  God commands life evermore.

Jesus Himself is our pasture,
He is the food that we eat;
We as His sheep are fed richly
Each time, whenever we meet.

  Glorious church life,
  Feasting from such a rich store!
  Here where we're dwelling in oneness
  God commands life evermore.

Dwell we here on a high mountain,
Wet with the morning-fresh dew,
Slaking our thirst at the fountain,
Water so living and new.

  Glorious church life,
  Feasting from such a rich store!
  Here where we're dwelling in oneness
  God commands life evermore.

Christ is our rest and enjoyment,
Here we have nothing to fear;
Here all the sheep dwell securely,
Kept by His presence so dear.

  Glorious church life,
  Feasting from such a rich store!
  Here where we're dwelling in oneness
  God commands life evermore.--------1222
Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of all,
Now He is dwelling in Jerusalem.
Tell among us all His doings great and small,
His throne, the heavens, yet He walks with men.
Oh, the salvation out of Zion comes;
He brought us back from our captivity.
Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad;
Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad!

In the Holy City with His own He dwells;
O Lord, our Lord how excellent Thy name!
He's enthroned upon the praises of His saints;
All His delight in Zion does remain.
The local churches are His move today
He is our portion, we are satisfied.
Oh, what a goodly heritage have we;
Oh, what a goodly heritage have we!

Who shall in His holy tabernacle dwell,
Who shall ascend to His most holy hill?
Those who seek for Him and purify their heart;
This generation now that seeks His face.
Oh, seek His face, ye children of the earth,
Open your heart, and let the King come in.
He will come in, and He shall live and reign;
He will come in, and He shall live and reign!

Look! God's tabernacle now is with the saints;
Emmanuel  God with us, we proclaim.
Everything is done, so let His children come;
Christ and the church  where God and man are one!
Lift up your heads, ye cities of the earth;
Open your gates, and let the King come in.
Shout to His praise  He's coming in to reign!
Shout to His praise  He's coming in to reign!--------1223
Psalm 48
Repeat the last line of each verse

O walk about, walk about Zion,
Go round about her in love.
O walk about, walk about Zion
And count the towers thereof.

O set your heart on her bulwarks,
O set your heart on her walls,
O set your heart on her bulwarks,
Consider her palaces.

In elevation how beauteous,
The joy of all the earth!
In elevation how beauteous
Is Zion, that city of worth!

O there is a river in Zion
That flows so deep and so broad.
O how the streams of that river
Make glad the city of God!

Praise waiteth for Thee, Lord, in Zion,
Praise waiteth, O God, for Thee,
Praise waiteth for Thee, Lord, in Zion,
For Zion is filled with Thee.

How great the Lord is in Zion,
How greatly to be praised,
How great He is in that city
Which over the earth is raised.

O bless the Lord out of Zion,
O let His praises swell,
O bless the Lord out of Zion,
Ye who in Jerusalem dwell.

The Lord bless thee out of Zion,
The Lord bless thee o'er and o'er!
The Lord bless thee out of Zion
With life for evermore!

Behold how good and how pleasant
With all the brethren to be!
Behold how good and how pleasant
To dwell in unity!

10 O tell it to all generations,
O tell it to all who will come,
O tell it to all generations,
The Spirit and Bride say, "Come!"--------1224
We from the law to Christ have turned;
To trust in Him by grace we've learned.
And since His glory we've discerned
We only care for Christ!

  We only care for Christ!
  We only care for Christ!
  And since His glory we've discerned
  We only care for Christ!

Christ brings us to God's house to dwell,
Where all day long His praises swell.
O hallelujah! None can tell
How lovely is God's house!

  How lovely is God's house!
  How lovely is God's house!
  O hallelujah! None can tell
  How lovely is God's house!

The house enlarged the city is;
The joy of all the nations 'tis,
The place for God to rule is this
On Zion's holy hill.

  On Zion's holy hill,
  On Zion's holy hill,
  The place for God to rule is this
  On Zion's holy hill.

From Zion Christ will take the earth
And reign and fill its souls with mirth.
All nations will proclaim His worth,
Break forth and sing for joy.

  Break forth and sing for joy,
  Break forth and sing for joy,
  All nations will proclaim His worth,
  Break forth and sing for joy.

Christ  house  the city  earth, we see;
Thus God's great plan fulfilled will be.
O brothers, let us utterly
Be one with Him for this.

  Be one with Him for this,
  Be one with Him for this,
  O brothers, let us utterly
  Be one with Him for this.--------1225
Lord, to know Thee as the Body,
Is my desperate need today,
Oh, to see Thee in Thy members,
'Tis for this I long and pray.
No more just to know Thy headship,
In an individual way,
But to see Thee incarnated,
As the Body-Christ, I pray.

Through the years, Thy saints have sought Thee,
Longing for reality;
Gazing upward, searching inward,
Thirsting for the sight of Thee.
Now reveal that Christ in heaven,
Is the Body manifest;
And the Christ who dwells within us
As the Body is expressed.

Prone to be misled, I know it,
By my lofty thoughts of Thee,
Easy 'tis for self to seek Thee,
Yet not touch reality,
Oh, how much I need to find Thee,
In Thy members here below.
God eternal dwells among us,
Manifest in flesh to know.

Limit, Lord, my independence,
Let me to Thy Body turn;
Not just seeking light from heaven,
But the church's sense to learn.
May we be the stones for building,
Not the formless, useless clay,
Gain in us Thy heart's desire,
Corporately Thyself display.--------1226
Oh, the church of Christ is glorious, and we are part of it
We're so happy that the Lord has made us one!
There's a Body in the universe and we belong to it
Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!

  Hallelujah for the Body!
  We are members of the Body!
  We are wholly for the Body!
  Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!

Not the individual Christians, but a corporate entity
God must have it for His full expression now;
Not just individual churches but the Body corporately
Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

  Hallelujah for the Body!
  Satan trembles at the Body!
  We're victorious in the Body!
  Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

There are seven golden lampstands in the nature all divine
Nothing natural does the Body life allow.
When we're one and share God's nature, how the lampstand then does shine
Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

  Hallelujah for the Body!
  For the lampstands of the Body!
  For the golden, shining Body!
  Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

How may we express such oneness, be divine and shining too?
Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!
He's the tree of life, the manna, and the feast that's ever new
Hallelujah, we may eat Him every day!

  We are one by eating Jesus!
  We're divine by eating Jesus!
  How we shine by eating Jesus!
  Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!--------1227
Our Lord, that One of peerless worth
Came first to die to give new birth;
He comes again to have on earth
A glorious Bride forever.

  Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
  Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
  Jesus! May our hearts make room
  To be Your Bride forever.

What our dear Lord desires the most,
Is not to just redeem the lost;
But that some saints would pay the cost,
To be His Bride forever.

  Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
  Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
  Jesus! May our hearts make room
  To be Your Bride forever.

As virgins we must single be,
No other husband could have we,
That when He comes we'll then be free
To be His Bride forever.

  Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
  Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
  Jesus! May our hearts make room
  To be Your Bride forever.

How could we love this fading world,
When Christ desires that one great pearl;
To Him we must our love unfurl
To bring Him back forever.

  Jesus! Oh, You're coming soon,
  Jesus! As our dear Bridegroom;
  Jesus! May our hearts make room
  To be Your Bride forever.--------1228
The Bible is the Word of God,
Its message is but one
Christ and the church, His holy Bride,
The two becoming one.

  Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
  That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
  And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.

The Father is the mighty God,
His purpose is but one
To find a Bride for Christ the Lord
And give her to His Son.

  Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
  That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
  And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.

The Son is Jesus Christ the Lord,
His heart desire's but one
To have a loving counterpart,
A Bride He's wooed and won.

  Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
  That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
  And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.

The Spirit is but Christ Himself,
He is the Lord applied
To generate the men of earth,
Transform them as His Bride.

  Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
  That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
  And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.

The living Word is Jesus too,
God-breathed as life to us,
That we be wholly sanctified,
A Bride all-glorious.

  Oh, what a miracle that we could be His Bride!
  Oh, what a miracle! All else we lay aside
  That we may now prepare to meet Him in the air
  And ever in our Bridegroom's love abide.--------1229
The church is Christ's deep longing
And His good pleasure too.
His every word and action
Is made with her in view.
His heart's love is established,
And nought can Him deter;
Before the earth's foundation
His thoughts were filled with her.

The eve of all creation
He mused on His delight,
And pondered every feature,
Well-pleasing in His sight.
Creation sprang to being,
But deep in Him did hide
A heart of depth unfathomed
Fixed on a glorious Bride.

And thus His will was 'stablished
His counterpart to gain:
This blessed, firm intention,
Eternally the same.
Though sin should e'en beguile man,
Then mock his helpless state,
He never could forsake her,
His yearning ne'er abate.

Then mercy richly flourished,
And love was, oh, so vast,
As graciously He sought her
With wisdom unsurpassed.
The love He gave to win her
God only comprehends!
His life laid down, an offering
Whose fragrance yet ascends.

And now in resurrection
To her He draws most near,
And with untold affection
In glory does appear.
As she beholds her Bridegroom,
His glory floods her heart,
'Til she, His Bride, is raptured,
His longed-for counterpart.--------1230
One new man is the Father's plan;
He redeemed us from the sons of men.
Every kindred, tribe and tongue,
In Himself He called us to be one.
God's expression on the earth
Now reveals His glorious worth.
One new man is the Father's plan;
He redeemed us from the sons of men.

On the cross ordinances slain,
That He might form just one of twain.
Reconciling us to God,
Thus on the serpent's head He trod.
He breaks down the middle wall
As upon His name we call;
On the cross ordinances slain,
That He might form just one of twain.

For this cause Your Person, Lord,
We take and stand in one accord;
All the members self forsake,
And of the Body-Christ partake.
We in Christ as one new man
Now come forth to take this land.
For this cause Your Person, Lord,
We take and stand in one accord.--------1231
O praise the Lord, God has a plan
That's why He formed a man;
To exercise authority,
Subdue the earth entirely.
O what a joy to be
In His recovery,
O praise God He made me a V.I.P.

O hallelujah, Christ became
A man to die for me.
And dying once my life to be,
In spirit now He lives in me.
The man supreme is He,
My all He came to be;
O hallelujah, He lives in me!

O hallelujah, I'm a man,
The center of God's plan.
I'm God's own image made to be,
Expressing His authority.
It's great to be a man,
O praise God, I'm a man,
O hallelujah, I am a man!

O hallelujah, one new man,
The building of God's plan!
God's plan throughout eternity
Not man, but men built corporately.
This man cannot be beat,
All things beneath his feet,
Christ and the church one man complete.--------1232
Ephesians 2-3

Once by nature we were dead in sin,
In a world of utter discord;
But together God has quickened us,
Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

Thus with all saints we can apprehend,
All the vast dimensions of God.
Knowing Christ's love passes all we know.
We're together filled to fullness with our God.

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

Now we know the purpose of our God,
Visible the mystery became:
Christ, the church, together now we see,
And together put the enemy to shame.

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

For this cause we pray the Father God
Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

In the Body we'll be fitly framed
As the many members Christ supply;
Working in the measure of each part,
All by growth in love the Body edify.

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.

Now we're one His purpose to fulfill,
As the one new man of His plan.
Unto Him be glory in the church,
And in Jesus Christ forevermore  Amen!

  Jesus is getting us together,
  Come and see the saints in one accord.
  His love is knitting us together,
  To the stature of the fullness of the Lord.--------1233
O home in the church,
Where we've ended our search
With the brothers rejoicing all day;
Where Christ is our life,
And we're through with all strife,
Now we're home, hallelujah, to stay!

  Home, home in the church;
  Yes, it's here that we've ended our search;
  And through all our days
  We will shout to His praise,
  "Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"

Here God is at rest,
Of His treasures the best
How His heart is rejoicing all day!
His home is our heart,
Ne'er for Satan a part,
Here His glory He'll fully display.

  God's home is the church;
  Yes, it's here that He ended His search;
  And through all our days
  We will shout to His praise,
  "Hallelujah for Christ and the church!"--------1234
I thirsted in the barren land of Babylon
And nothing satisfying there I found;
But to the blessed local church one day I came,
Where springs of living water do abound.

  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  Happy now am I,
  My heart they satisfy;
  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  O wonderful and bountiful supply!

How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
It's flowing in and flowing out of me;
O now I've found the place for which I long had sought,
Where there is life and life abundantly.

  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  Happy now am I,
  My heart they satisfy;
  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  O wonderful and bountiful supply!

O brother, won't you gather in the local church?
A fountain here is flowing deep and wide.
The Shepherd now would bring you to the local church,
Where thirsty spirits can be satisfied.

  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  Happy now am I,
  My heart they satisfy;
  Drinking at the springs of living water,
  O wonderful and bountiful supply!--------1235
Oh, listen to the wanderer
In whom there was a lack;
Then hearken to the song he sings
And follow in his track.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

A wanderer within the world
For pleasure ever seeks;
Be it in body or in mind,
With vanity it reeks.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

For self I labored day and night,
My castles built in sand;
But, praise the Lord, He wrecked them all
Much better things He planned.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

Once all for self  confused, alone,
How could I bear the shame?
But now within the local church
I'll never be the same.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

I am a happy member now
Within the local church.
A wanderer has found his home
And ended all his search.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

I was an individualist,
An island in myself;
But now the Lord is building me
With others in Himself

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

I'm drawn together with His own
In fellowship so sweet.
I've learned from others to receive
Of Christ whene'er we meet.

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!

My wanderings have really ceased
I've found the church, God's best!
The secret of my happiness
Enjoying God's own rest!

  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  Praise the Lord, Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
  I'll never be the same!--------1236
In the church the sound of life upon our ear is falling,
Then we see the joy of Christ expressed on every hand;
Babylon and things of earth in vain to us are calling.
We are home forever in Christ our land.

  We're churching in the Spirit
  On the church's local ground;
  We're churching with our brothers,
  Our family we have found.
  Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
  With hallelujahs for Christ our land!

Far away our background seems with all its gifts and teaching,
Farther still, the worldly things with all their foul demand;
As the love of Jesus Christ our inmost heart is reaching,
Not a thing can move us from Christ our land.

  We're churching in the Spirit
  On the church's local ground;
  We're churching with our brothers,
  Our family we have found.
  Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
  With hallelujahs for Christ our land!

"I will build My church upon this rock," said the Lord Jesus,
And we see the building of His purpose and His plan;
Setting members in the Body as Himself it pleases,
Building us together in Christ our land.

  We're churching in the Spirit
  On the church's local ground;
  We're churching with our brothers,
  Our family we have found.
  Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
  With hallelujahs for Christ our land!

Now the Lord's recovery is everywhere proceeding,
All the churches join in one to give the Lord command:
"Speed the day when all the earth will echo with pray-reading
And with hallelujahs for Christ our land."

  We're churching in the Spirit
  On the church's local ground;
  We're churching with our brothers,
  Our family we have found.
  Oh, yes, we're churching with the churches, and we'll make the earth resound
  With hallelujahs for Christ our land!--------1237
Splendid church life! His green garden!
He has brought us, praise the Lord!
To experience the Christ Who's growing here!
He is full of rich enjoyment to His saints in one accord;
He is new and fresh, available and dear!

  I'm so happy in this lovely place,
  In the garden growing in His grace!
  There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
  And to get the living water into me.

It is not a school or factory or a chapel in the air;
But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.
So He's placed us all here corporately to be His garden fair,
Where He's free to cultivate and make us grow.

  I'm so happy in this lovely place,
  In the garden growing in His grace!
  There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
  And to get the living water into me.

Thus within the church-life garden there's a fruit-producing tree
Full of life and so available to eat.
So be simple, don't be hardened, drop your concepts  eat that tree!
Take in Jesus every moment  He's so sweet!

  I'm so happy in this lovely place,
  In the garden growing in His grace!
  There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
  And to get the living water into me.

With the tree there is the water, flowing God in Christ to us,
Quenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.
Hallelujah! In His garden Jesus flows Himself to us,
As the full supply for us to grow in life.

  I'm so happy in this lovely place,
  In the garden growing in His grace!
  There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
  And to get the living water into me.

Aren't you satisfied and thankful that our Lord has brought you in
Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
So be happy and be joyful, in the spirit feast on Him,
So God's garden can bear fruit abundantly.

  I'm so happy in this lovely place,
  In the garden growing in His grace!
  There is no finer pleasure than to eat the living tree
  And to get the living water into me.--------1238
Never did I dream before,
Such a place could e'er be found,
Where the tears of sorrow cease,
Songs of endless joy abound.
One who seldom ever sang,
Now delights his voice to raise;
Singing hymns with all the saints,
Echoing the ceaseless praise.

Day by day the world goes on,
Just as it has gone before.
Millions grasp and clutch at life,
Wond'ring if there could be more;
Such was I and would be, yet
Mercy found me out somehow;
With what gratefulness I say,
"I'm in God's own family now."

How delightful 'tis to know;
How subjective, real, and sweet
Is this inward joy of grace
We experience when we meet;
Life abundant Jesus gives
As my full reality;
Praise You, Lord, it's really true,
I'm in Your own family.

At the closing of this age,
Just before Your kingdom's dawn,
May You gain a people, Lord,
For Your dwelling place, Your home.
Since for me You gave Your all,
Everything I lay aside;
For Your church my all I'd give,
That You would be satisfied.--------1239
In this age we're being turned
To the Spirit to be burned;
Now in spirit we can see
Christ, the church, our unity!

In the spirit we can taste
All the riches of Thy grace;
All Thy fullness, blessed Lord
Is for those in one accord!

In the spirit, on the ground
Here is where Thy life is found.
Dwelling thus in unity,
We enjoy reality!

Out of death and into life,
Done with all divisive strife!
Free indeed to love but Thee,
Growing to maturity!

"Amen, Jesus," is our prayer
To the purging work, whate'er;
Now Thy church must desperate be
More the growth in life to see.

O Lord, make Thy home our heart,
Our true inner man Thou art;
God and man are mingled thus
Christ, the church, all glorious!--------1240
Deeper, deeper, in the cross of Jesus;
Deeper let me go;
Death and life, they always go together;
Deepen, Lord, the flow.
Oh, deeper yet we pray,
Do work in us each day;
Go deeper, through and through,
Till in Thee we're wholly new.

Higher, higher, in the life of Jesus;
Lord, we are so low.
By Thy life we all can go much higher
Higher let us go.
Oh, higher yet we pray  Transform us every day
And richer in the flow;
May Thy life be all we know.

Growing, growing, in us He is growing,
More and more each day.
Into all our living He is flowing
This is now His way.
For growth, O Lord, we pray;
Increase in us each day.
It's not enough to know;
Now Thy life in us must grow.

Living, living, Christ is all our living,
He's so practical:
Small things, big things, anything and all things
He's involved in all.
Live Christ in every way;
Oh, live Him out today.
His name you now must call,
And give Him your all for all.

Person, Person, Jesus is our Person,
Living now in us.
He's our tastes, our attitudes and actions;
Oh, how glorious!
Our Person, Lord, Thou art;
Make home in all our heart.
As life in every way
Be our Person, Lord, each day.

Churches, churches, in the local churches
We all find the flow:
Deeper, higher, Christ as all our living,
For the church we grow.
The churches are today
Just Christ in every way.
For this, from self we cease,
For Thy Body, Thine increase.

Building, building, we will see the building
Of the church this way:
Christ experienced will produce the building
He's the only way.
Oh, build us, Lord, we pray,
By growth of life each day.
Oh, make us now such men
For the New Jerusalem.

Coming, coming, Jesus soon is coming
For His chosen Bride.
In the churches we are all preparing
To be glorified.
Lord Jesus, come again
This cry is deep within.
We'll praise Thee to the end,
Oh, come back! Come back! Amen!--------1241
  Song of Songs
  Repeat the last line of each verse

God's life and building can be seen
Within the Song of Songs;
He shows by types His seeking ones,
The Bride for whom Christ longs!

She, as a team of horses shows
A love, so swift and strong!
But this is love that's natural
It pulls the world along!

As time goes by, her concepts change,
With dove's eyes she can see
That naught can with her love compare
There's none so dear as He!

A lily she is now to Him
(For still the Lord draws on),
Her faith is not in earthly toil,
But in the wondrous Son.

She's next a dove who hides herself
Within a cloven rock;
Now in her Lord's ascended life
Is love which knows no shock!

Of smoke, a pillar she's become,
And now, as wand'ring ends,
Her wills to His will are subdued,
What fragrance sweet ascends!

Behold His couch... (O, can this be?)
E'en midst the fearsome night...
She now affords her Lord such rest,
The foe is put to flight!

A vessel to contain the King!
(This type is full of worth.)
A palanquin He's made Himself
For His move on the earth!

Of wood this vessel is composed:
Christ's ris'n humanity.
Its silver pillars for support
And floor of gold we see!

10 The seat of purple signifies
Christ is of kings the King.
To Him, as fittings for within,
Their love His dear ones bring!

11 The day will come  ('tis surely soon)
And glad will be Thy heart
What boast and glory to Thyself;
Thy crown, Thy counterpart!

12 A garden fair, enclosed is she
With spices, fragrant, sweet.
She now brings forth materials
The building to complete!

13 A city pleasant, comely, too;
No greater building, this!
So beautiful, yet to the foe
A conq'ring army 'tis!

14 As we eat Jesus, praise the Lord,
The transformation's done,
Until at last, the work's complete
Christ and His Bride are one!--------1242
The Lord, the seed of life, has sown Himself into our heart
To grow up into fullness and become His counterpart.
The seed requires no rules or forms, for water is its need
By this the all-inclusive seed will grow in us indeed!

  The seed is simply Jesus! Oh, Jesus lives in me!
  And by His growth this seed in us will reach maturity.

The growth of Christ, the seed, in us will soon produce the wheat,
The life within break forth  yet work divine is not complete;
For wheat alone can never be the seed's expression true;
So all the grains must blend together into something new.

  The seed is simply Jesus; now wheat is Jesus too!
  The grains of wheat must blend together into something new.

The individual grains of wheat no longer must be free,
But crushed together, ground to powder, every grain must be,
Until the wheat becomes the meal from which the loaf is formed
Till all the saints will blend and to His Body be conformed.

  We all must take the grinding until the Christ within
  Can mold into His Body all the individual grains.

The seed is planted, wheat is grown and meal is the sum
Of all the growth upon God's farm, where Christians grow as one;
But all the growth in life is for the building of the church,
That God and man may have a home and both may end their search.

  The farm is for the building, for God and man a home,
  Where both may dwell among His people gathered into one.

God's building is produced by silver, precious stones, and gold
From meal through transformation, pressure, heat, and pain untold.
The meal must not be satisfied to stay as meal alone,
But must submit to transformation into precious stone.

  The meal must pass through suffering that precious stones be formed;
  Then built into God's building, to His purpose full conformed.

From fullest growth and transformation comes a pearl of worth;
This simple, precious, all-inclusive gem will then come forth.
Conceived in death and formed in life by that all-glorious One,
The church, His Bride, the fruit of all the work that He has done.

  The pearl is what He's after, the Bride to please His heart,
  So single, pure and precious, and His very counterpart.

The growth in life begins when planted on God's farm we're found;
The growing seed becomes the wheat from which the meal is ground.
But building work proceeds when meal submits to be transformed;
Then gold and silver, precious stones for building will be formed.

  The farm is for the building, built up by precious stones,
  From which the priceless pearl comes forth to be His Bride, His own.

Lord, keep us poor in spirit, pure in heart that we may be
Good ground in which the seed of life may grow abundantly,
Until the final stage is reached and You are satisfied
And have Your priceless, chosen pearl, Your joy complete, Your Bride.

  Lord, keep us poor in spirit and purified in heart,
  That growing up in us You may bring forth Your counterpart.--------1243
We are one in the spirit, by His life we are one,
We have left all divisions, Body-life has begun,
For the Lord broke all barriers, proclaiming, "It is done."

  Brothers:
  In the church we are brothers,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

  Sisters:
  In the church we are sisters,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
  (Praise the Lord!)

  Everyone:
  And we praise Him that our unity
  has now been restored.

We are one in the spirit, yet it goes deeper still,
For this oneness is spreading to our mind, emotion, will,
As we all stand together that His purpose He fulfill.

  Brothers:
  In the church we are brothers,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

  Sisters:
  In the church we are sisters,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
  (Praise the Lord!)

  Everyone:
  And we praise Him that our unity
  has now been restored.

We are one in the spirit, we are one actually,
Not in talk nor in theory, but in fact, practically,
In the churches we're all enjoying this reality.

  Brothers:
  In the church we are brothers,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

  Sisters:
  In the church we are sisters,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
  (Praise the Lord!)

  Everyone:
  And we praise Him that our unity
  has now been restored.

We are one in the spirit in each locality,
For the Lord's own intention we would consecrated be,
That the oneness He's given us the whole world may see.

  Brothers:
  In the church we are brothers,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!

  Sisters:
  In the church we are sisters,
  Praise the Lord, praise the Lord!
  (Praise the Lord!)

  Everyone:
  And we praise Him that our unity
  has now been restored.--------1244
Psalm 133

Behold how good a thing
It is to dwell in peace;
How pleasing to our King,
This fruit of righteousness;
When brethren all in one agree,
They know the joy of unity!

When all are sweetly joined
(True followers of the Lamb),
They're one in heart and mind,
They think and speak the same;
When all in love together dwell;
The comfort is unspeakable!

Where unity takes place,
The joys of heav'n we prove;
This is the gospel grace,
The unction from above;
The Spirit on all saints is shed,
Descending swift from Christ the Head.

Where unity is found,
The sweet anointing grace
Extends to all around,
And shines from every face;
To every praising saint it comes,
And fills him with divine perfumes.

On all His chosen ones
The precious oil comes down:
Anointing as it runs,
Anointing on and on.
E'en to His skirts (the meanest name
That longs to love the bleeding Lamb).

From Aaron's beard it rolls,
(Those nearest to His face),
The humble, trembling souls
Who know abundant grace;
The grace, the grace for all is free,
For, lo, it reaches now to me!--------1245
Thessalonians 1:6; Philippians 3:17

When the brothers are in order,
And you sense Christ is their life,
Follow them and watch for Jesus,
Ending thus your thought and strife.

  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  When you sense Christ is their life,
  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.

When you follow, as you follow,
Take the blood, and call His name;
Much assurance He will give you,
And the enemy you'll shame.

  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  When you sense Christ is their life,
  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.

When they speak, as they are speaking,
Open wide your heart to them,
Thus the Word of God receiving,
Word of God, and not of men.

  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  When you sense Christ is their life,
  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.

Now the Word of God is running,
Running fast, and running free.
This is how the Lord is moving,
In His own recovery.

  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  When you sense Christ is their life,
  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.

O be glad, rejoice, dear brothers,
For the coming wedding day.
Then the Bride will be made ready
Those who followed all the way.

  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  When you sense Christ is their life,
  Follow brothers, follow sisters,
  Help prepare the Bride for Christ.--------1246
We give ourselves to follow the churches,
Oneness in Christ display;
Follow His move in all of the churches,
Stand fast as one this way.

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!

We give ourselves to follow the followers,
By this we truly learn;
Never desiring to be the leaders,
But to the Spirit turn.

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!

We give ourselves the flock's steps to follow,
Knowing the Shepherd's care.
Now in the churches Jesus is leading
And He is speaking there.

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!

We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,
Never to turn aside;
Where'er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,
Follow whate'er betide.

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!

We give ourselves to enter the kingdom,
That marriage feast, with Him;
Come persecution, suffering, and trials,
Still we will enter in.

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!

Christ wants some followers here in the churches,
Followers of whom to say:
"These saw My purpose, followed Me wholly"
May we be those today!

  We must follow the Spirit
  In all simplicity.
  In our spirit is Jesus
  He follows perfectly!--------1247
If our hearts would be established;
If in spirit we would be;
If we would be overcomers;
Follow Jesus constantly.

  Follow Jesus in the spirit;
  Be the overcomers true;
  Follow Jesus every moment
  Jesus, help us follow You.

If we would be built together;
If related we would be;
To be fitly framed together;
Follow brothers constantly.

  Follow brothers for the building;
  Never independent be;
  Follow brothers, be in order,
  Functioning in harmony.

If we're for the Lord's recovery;
If the earth the Lord's would be;
If we would bring in the kingdom;
Follow churches constantly.

  Follow all the local churches;
  Thus, the kingdom we will see.
  Follow in the churches' flowing
  For the Lord's recovery.

We would all be better followers,
Taking in with joy the Word;
It enables us to follow
Brothers, churches, and our Lord.

  Follow Jesus; follow brothers;
  Follow churches in the flow;
  By the Word of God amening
  We can all attain this goal.--------1248
Recall how David swore,
"I'll not come into my house,
Nor go up to my bed,
Give slumber to mine eyelids,
Until I find a place for Thee,
A place, O Lord, for Thee."
Our mighty God desires a home
Where all His own may come.

How blinded we have been,
Shut in with what concerns us;
While God's house lieth waste
Lord, break through, overturn us;
We'll go up to the mountain,
Bring wood and build the house;
We'll never say, "Another day!"
It's time! We'll come and build!

O Lord, against these days,
Inspire some for Your building,
Just as in David's day
A remnant who are willing
To come and work in Your house,
Oh, what a blessed charge!
Your heart's desire, is our desire
We come, O Lord, to build.

Within those whom You'd call
Put such a restless caring
For building to give all
These times are for preparing;
The gates of hell cannot prevail
Against the builded Church!
The hours are few, the builders too
Lord, build, O build in us!
Repeat the last four lines--------1249
How oft believers through the years
Have sought the will of Jesus,
And would have offered everything
To walk as Him it pleases.
If you should seek the will of God,
Don't waste another minute;
The church life is His glorious will,
And you too must get in it.

"What is the will of God for me?"
How oft you've asked this question.
It is the church life, corporately,
Where God finds His expression.
Don't watch the church life from afar,
Or erringly construe it;
Come gaze upon it from within
You'll give your whole life to it.

The church life here is realized,
'Tis all the Lord intended;
And in this rich experience
All further seeking's ended.
The church life is His glorious will
Now for yourself begin it.
The surest way to know His will
Is simply to get in it.

So let us give our all for this,
And hold ourselves not dearly;
The church life is the will of God,
Let's take our standing clearly.
Oh, we have found the will of God;
Christ died and rose to win it.
The church life is His glorious will,
And, praise the Lord, we're in it!--------1250
Psalm 132

O surely I will not come in
Within my house to stay,
Nor yet give sleep unto my eyes,
Till Jesus has His way.
Upon the earth, the Lord desires
A place where He may live;
For this, Thy habitation, Lord,
Myself I fully give.

We heard of it while yet far off,
We found it in the way;
We then came up into her courts,
And here we'll ever stay.
Arise, O Lord, into Thy rest,
Thou and Thy ark so strong.
Thy priests are clothed with righteousness;
Thy saints with joy and song.

The Lord has sworn in truth to us,
He will not turn away
His Seed shall sit with Him enthroned,
And reign with Him for aye.
The Lord hath found a place to dwell,
Hath chosen Zion fair;
His habitation it will be,
It is His rest fore'er.

Her food abundant He will bless,
Her needy, satisfy;
And with salvation clothe her priests,
And all her want supply.
The horn of David's budding here,
A lamp for earth's dark night.
His enemies are clothed with shame,
His saints with crowns of light.

And now within these latter days,
Amidst earth's dark unrest,
God's house is being built again
And all His people blessed.
Secure within the local church,
With saints in one accord
We meet to just release our praise,
And thus enjoy the Lord.--------1251
Ezra 1-3

To Jerusalem we've come,
We are through with Babylon,
We have gathered to be one,
O glory be to God!
Of the teachings we're bereft,
All opinions we have left,
Spirit from the soul is cleft,
In the local churches now.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are all in one accord
  For the building of the Lord,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are living in the local churches now!

That recovery may proceed
Real priests are what we need
Those who live in Christ indeed,
O glory be to God!
Saturated with the Lord,
They have Christ as their reward.
These the building work afford
In the local churches now.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are all in one accord
  For the building of the Lord,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are living in the local churches now!

And the kingship we must see
With divine authority
To this rule we'll all agree,
O glory be to God!
To the Spirit we'll submit
For the church's benefit
This is His prerequisite
In the local churches now.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are all in one accord
  For the building of the Lord,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are living in the local churches now!

We the altar must obtain,
Have our all upon it lain.
The burnt-offering must be slain,
O glory be to God!
This we never should dispute,
For the church be absolute,
All that's otherwise uproot
In the local churches now.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are all in one accord
  For the building of the Lord,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are living in the local churches now!

The foundation now is laid
O what glory doth pervade!
We are all with joy arrayed,
O glory be to God!
Let us raise a mighty shout
They will hear us far without,
And the enemy we'll rout
In the local churches now.

  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are all in one accord
  For the building of the Lord,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  We are living in the local churches now!--------1252
Ezra 1

Down in Babylon, in captivity,
Oh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!
Scattered everywhere, without unity,
Oh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!

  Stirred up! Stirred up!
  Oh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!

Up from Babylon, where the sects abound,
From division we must all rise up!
Brothers, Babylon's not the proper ground;
From division we must all rise up!

  Rise up! Rise up!
  From division we must all rise up!

To Jerusalem, from captivity,
God is with us, let us all go up!
To the one unique ground of unity,
God is with us, let us all go up!

  Go up! Go up!
  God is with us, let us all go up!

Platters full of Christ, bowls with Spirit filled
All the vessels of the Lord bring up!
Bring them to the church as the Lord has willed
All the vessels of the Lord bring up!

  Bring up! Bring up!
  All the vessels of the Lord bring up!

In Jerusalem, chosen of the Lord,
Now the temple of the Lord build up!
Serve with all the saints, share in one accord,
Now the temple of the Lord build up!

  Build up! Build up!
  Now the temple of the Lord build up!--------1253
Lord, Thy word of old to David
We have heard and hear it now:
"On Thy throne will sit forever
Thine own seed  this is My vow."
This has been fulfilled in Jesus
Seated on the throne on high,
Sitting on the throne of David
Resurrected, ne'er to die.

Then another promise followed
David's seed upon the throne:
"I'll rebuild His tabernacle
And by this I will be known."
Lord, we thank Thee, Thou art faithful
To perform Thy promised word.
David's tabernacle, ruined,
Soon by Thee will be restored.

Lord, we are that tabernacle,
Thy rebuilding work on earth;
Lord, restore Thyself a dwelling
Where is seen Thy boundless worth.
Thus shall all of mankind seek Thee,
And the Gentiles call Thy name.
From Thy holy tabernacle
All the earth shall know Thy fame.

Hasten, Lord, Thy work upon us
To restore and build us now.
For this work we give ourselves, Lord;
Here to Thee we make a vow:
"Though our strength is weak and feeble,
Yet our hearts would ever be
From this day, Lord, for Thy building,
Now and for eternity."--------1254
Haggai 1

This is the time for building the temple of the Lord
That all the local churches may fully be restored.
'Tis not the time for our house while God's house lieth waste
O brothers, for God's building, rise up, make haste!

  Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
  The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
  Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
  That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.

O hear, the Lord is speaking: Consider now your ways,
Ye sow and bring in little, for lacking is My praise.
Go up into the mountain, material to provide,
And build My house that I may be glorified.

  Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
  The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
  Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
  That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.

Ye who are priests, ye remnant of Christians now obey
The Lord Himself is with us, whatever men may say,
With spirits stirred and burning, now let us come to work;
May none his part with others in building shirk.

  Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
  The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
  Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
  That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.

I'll fill this house with glory, the Lord of hosts has said,
And the desire of nations will be exhibited.
Its glory will be greater than all that's gone before,
And we will share this glory forevermore.

  Be strong, be strong, God's dwelling place to build!
  The Lord of hosts is with us, with His glory 'twill be filled!
  Be strong, be strong, and work in one accord,
  That all the nations may behold the temple of the Lord.--------1255
We are for the Lord's recovery
Of the local church;
We are for the Lord's recovery
Of the city and the earth.
Standing on the ground of oneness,
Oneness in the Lord,
We are building up the temple
Of our glorious Lord.

  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's recovery!
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's recovery!

We are for the Lord's recovery!
To our hearts so dear;
When we exercise our spirit,
Our vision is so clear.
Babylon the Great is fallen,
Satan is cast down,
And the local church is builded
On the local ground.

  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's recovery!
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's,
  We are for the Lord's recovery!--------1256
Praise the Lord, we're in the Lord's recovery
Home at last, here in the church.
Praise the Lord, we're in the new creation
One new man, the end of our search.
With the saints, builded, coordinated;
No more I, forever "we".
We are one in the Son, standing here till He comes;
Yes, nothing can stop our God till He's done!--------1257
Do you see them in the cities,
Meeting on the local ground?
They're the local, golden lampstands,
Where the Lord His home has found.

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Do you see them in the meetings,
Lifting up their voice on high,
Every brother, sister sharing,
Christ the Lord to magnify?

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Do you hear them all pray-reading,
Breathing in the living Word?
Praying, praising, drinking, feeding,
How they all enjoy the Lord!

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Do you hear them call, "Lord Jesus"?
How they love that blessed name!
All the more their joy increases
As His Lordship they proclaim.

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Have you heard their hallelujahs,
Like a mighty thunder blast?
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Down the enemy is cast!

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Do you see the saints migrating?
Praise the Lord the move is on
For the church in every city
That our blessed Lord may come!

'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!
'Tis the local church, the church God has chosen,
Where all the saints dwell as one!

Do you see the Lord is coming
For the church for whom He died?
In the churches He's preparing
Now His holy, chosen Bride.

'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Filled with the glory of the Lord!
'Tis a glorious church without spot or wrinkle,
Filled with the glory of the Lord!--------1258
Psalm 84

Oh, how lovable, how precious
Are Thy local churches, Lord!
My soul longeth, even fainteth
For the courts of Thine abode;
'Tis my heart's deep thirst and longing
And my spirit deeply sighs;
Fellowship among the churches
For this my whole being cries.

Blessed is the man whose heart, to
Zion, is an open way;
He's the one whose strength is in Thee;
He will praise Thee all the day.
In communion with the churches,
Trusting Thee, Thy praise he sings;
Passing through the weeping valley,
It becomes a place of springs.

One day spent among Thy churches,
Better than a thousand is!
Even to the lowest member,
Sun and shield Jehovah is.
Grace and glory, every good thing,
On us now He doth outpour;
Blessed is that man who dwelleth
In the churches evermore.--------1259
See the local churches,
'Midst the earth's dark night;
Jesus' testimony,
Bearing Him as light.
Form by Him, unmeasured,
In the Spirit's mold
All are one in nature.
One pure work of gold.

  See the local churches,
  'Midst the earth's dark night;
  Burning in the Spirit,
  Shining forth with Christ.

God in Christ, embodied,
As God's lampstand, He
Has become the Spirit,
The reality.
Spirit as the lampstand
Has been multiplied;
Many local churches,
Now are realized!

  See the local churches,
  'Midst the earth's dark night;
  Burning in the Spirit,
  Shining forth with Christ.

Caring for the churches
Is the Son of Man:
Voice of many waters,
Stars in His right hand;
Eyes aflame; His face is
Shining as the sun;
Churches  fear no trial,
He's the living One!

  See the local churches,
  'Midst the earth's dark night;
  Burning in the Spirit,
  Shining forth with Christ.

What can quench the lampstands?
Who can them defy?
More the opposition
More they multiply!
Deeper darkness 'round them,
Brighter do they shine.
They are constituted
With the life divine.

  See the local churches,
  'Midst the earth's dark night;
  Burning in the Spirit,
  Shining forth with Christ.

Soon the local churches
Shall the Bride become,
Bringing in that city  New Jerusalem.
Then the many lampstands
Shall one lampstand be;
Triune God expressing,
Universally.

  Lo, from heav'n descending,
  All the earth shall see
  God's complete expression,
  For eternity.--------1260
  We're in the local church,
  God's chosen ground;
  Here we have Christ as life
  And blessings all abound.
  "In spirit, on the ground"  Our battle cry;
  And we will overcome the enemy
  To bring the kingdom nigh.--------1261
*The name of the city may be replaced with any 3-syllable name; or in the place of "in Chicago", "here in Akron", or "here in Houston" may be sung.

In Chicago* land we must take our stand
To meet Thy demand in these days.
Lord, Thy purpose great doth our heart elate,
As Thy name we now exalt and praise.

  Purpose, purpose, Thine eternal purpose;
  Show forth Christ and shame the enemy;
  Purpose, purpose, Thine eternal purpose;
  In Chicago realized must be.

All things we forsake for Thy Body's sake,
Soul-life for us break in Thy way.
We've been wrecked by Thee, since Thy plan we see;
On Thine altar everything we lay.

  Break us! Break us! For Thy purpose break us.
  Grant our spirits, Lord, a full release;
  Break us! Break us! For Thy purpose break us;
  In Chicago, Jesus must increase.

With this vision clear and Thy presence dear,
Our hearts have no fear  forth we go.
Lord, Thy heart's desire has set us afire;
To Thy chosen ones this vision show:

  Lampstand, lampstand, see the golden lampstand,
  Shining with the glory of the Lord.
  Lampstand, lampstand, see the golden lampstand,
  In Chicago, Jesus Christ is Lord.--------1262
It's by our mingled spirit, Lord,
That we can shine with Thee,
And be a golden lampstand now
For all the world to see.
It's not by forms or rituals,
Mere Christianity;
It's by our Christ enjoyed as life
We all can shine with Thee.

The burning Christ has feet as brass
Which in the furnace burns,
His eyes are as a flame of fire
'Tis to this Christ we turn!
How could we ever lukewarm be
When on His face we gaze?
O Lord, we give ourselves to You
To set us all ablaze!

The seven golden lampstands in
The seven cities see,
So burning, shining with this Christ,
It's God's economy!
We're absolute that this become
Our full reality
Upon the earth, within the church
In each locality.--------1263
*The name of the city may be replaced with other names that fit the meter: e.g. San Diego, San Francisco. Or, the first line of each verse may be sung as follows: There's a living church in Dallas, Houston, Cleveland, etc.

There's a church in New York City*,
Standing on the local ground;
There's a lampstand brightly beaming,
Shining out to millions 'round.
We were raised from every nation,
Every people, tribe, and tongue
With us God has gained a dwelling,
'Tis where all His own may come.

In your midst, O New York City,
Little do you realize
Fallen is a seed within you,
'Midst corruption it shall rise;
Rising up in resurrection,
With an increase many fold,
It shall blossom, manifesting
Riches of God's life untold.

For the church in New York City
Faithfully the saints have prayed.
'Gainst the church in New York City
How the devil is enraged!
For behold, within the center
Of his kingdom, dark and grim,
God has gained a testimony,
Moving, fighting on for Him.

There's a church in New York City
Who the gospel does proclaim,
To the hungry, poor, and weary,
Sick, imprisoned, and the lame.
Now this gospel of the kingdom
Shall be preached until the end;
Till the Lord who with the kingdom
Of the heavens does descend.

There's a church in New York City,
Honoring the risen Christ;
Caring for the other churches
Following in truth and light;
With them in coordination,
We the kingdom will possess;
Fighting as one mighty army,
Till the kingdom's manifest.--------1264
In the age of Revelation,
Out from all denomination,
We are in the local churches,
In spirit one.
Nothing old or religious binds,
Everyone's a star that shines;
Every church a golden lampstand,
Burning with Christ.

  Christ and a burning church,
  Christ and a burning church,
  Christ and the church with the saints,
  all shining stars!
  Hallelujah, hallelujah,
  Lord, we've given our all to Thee
  To be burning in the spirit, to be
  shining forth with Christ.--------1265
The churches are the Body
Of Christ on earth today.
They are His testimony,
That He may have a way.
They are the golden lampstands
In cities far and wide.
They are His fighting army,
And His beloved Bride.

  The churches, the churches,
  Upon the earth today;
  Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
  And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

Oh, how we need the churches,
All of them, great or small!
We need their many portions
To profit us withal.
Yes, Lord, enlarge the churches;
We love their needs to bear.
Enlarge our hearts, Lord Jesus,
In fellowship and prayer.

  The churches, the churches,
  Upon the earth today;
  Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
  And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

The Lord's eyes o'er the whole earth
Are running to and fro;
Those seven, burning, searching,
Our heart's desire to know.
His purpose  many churches,
Built up in one accord;
This golden testimony
Will thus express the Lord.

  The churches, the churches,
  Upon the earth today;
  Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
  And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.

And soon will be the coming
Of our triumphant King!
He's coming for the churches
Where His sweet praises ring.
Come, Lord, come reap the firstfruits,
As draws the harvest nigh,
And to Thy throne do take us,
To reign with Thee on high.

  The churches, the churches,
  Upon the earth today;
  Lord, stir our hearts for Thy desire,
  And build us, oh, build us, Lord, we pray.--------1266
Burning, burning, we are burning,
Ever to our spirits turning,
One for Thine eternal purpose,
in spirit one;
On the ground of locality,
We express our unity
Many members, but one Body,
Christ as our Head.

  Christ and the local church,
  Christ and the local church,
  Christ and the church, our reality and life,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Lord, we've given our lives to You,
  For the building of Your Body,
  For our building up in love.

Breathing, breathing, we are breathing,
With each breath new life receiving,
What a transformation from the old
to the new;
Breathing out the old life from us,
Breathing in new life and oneness,
We are breathing in of Jesus, we are
breathing in of life.

  Christ and the local church,
  Christ and the local church,
  Christ and the church, our reality and life,
  Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
  Lord, we've given our lives to You,
  For the building of Your Body,
  For our building up in love.--------1267
We are for the great migration,
And, O Lord, we seek Thy face.
Who? and when? and where? Lord Jesus,
Grant us now Thy blessed grace.

This is for Thy house and city,
This is for Thy kingdom, Lord;
To subdue the earth before us
We are all in one accord.

Of the Father, through Christ Jesus,
By the Spirit's flowing free;
In our spirit, on the church-ground
This the way of victory.

Burden us with Thy great plan, Lord;
Consecrated we would be.
To fulfill Thy holy purpose
Saturate us thoroughly.

Build, O build us all together,
Let us here our lessons learn,
Send us forth to many cities
For the church-life there to burn.

Many places need a beachhead
To bring in Thy reign and rule.
Lord, build up the local churches
That Thy kingdom come in full!

Then the earth will give Thee glory
And the devil get the shame.
For Thy kingdom's rule and reigning
All will praise Thy glorious name.

Blessed days are quickly coming;
We rejoice and give Thee praise
For the glorious consummation
And Thy royal ruling days.

Hallelujah to the Father,
Hallelujah to the Son,
Hallelujah to the Spirit
Hallelujah, it is done!

10 Hallelujah for the churches,
Hallelujah for the saints,
Hallelujah for the meetings
And their holy, sweet constraints!

11 Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah we will sing;
Hallelujah, hallelujah,
Hallelujah to our King!--------1268
Genesis 6-8

When Noah worked upon the ark as God to him decreed,
So many others watched, yet to his words they gave no heed.
But Noah heard the voice of God and did His word obey;
His business was to build the ark; he couldn't waste a day.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.

The generation at that time was evil and perverse;
The wickedness upon the earth was waxing worse and worse.
But Noah stood against the age and ne'er the vision lost.
The ark of testimony must be built at any cost.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.

There were at that time many men who said they worshipped God;
They served Him and they sacrificed and yet 'twas very odd,
The very thing that God desired they mocked and ridiculed.
Their heart was set upon this age and by the devil ruled.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.

One day the ark was finished and eight souls were led aboard.
God shut the door and then the heavens opened and outpoured.
It rained, but Noah took no thought for he was safe inside.
When all the earth was flooded, he above it all did ride.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.

The ark was just God's testimony on the earth that time.
For God had found a corporate man through whom His light could shine.
He needed something built through which He'd fully be expressed,
And now it is the local church where God is manifest.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.

Be careful lest this age would lead you from God's heart's desire.
For Jesus' testimony must set all our hearts afire.
The local churches are the ark, God's testimony true.
For this we leave the age behind and give our hearts anew.

  Now Jesus' testimony, we in the churches see,
  The ark of testimony built in each locality.--------1269
There in old Chaldea, product of man's fall,
God appeared to Abram  called him from it all.
"Get thee from thy country, from thy father's clan,
Get thee from thy kindred to another land."

  Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
  One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.

Through the Lord's infusion, Abraham became
Father of the faithful  life had changed his name.
Though the Lord's appearing, brought him to the land,
Still he needed Isaac to fulfill God's plan.

  Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
  One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.

Isaac from his father did inherit all:
Sonship's full enjoyment, blessing of God's call.
Though all things receiving, incomplete was he;
Lacking transformation and maturity.

  Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
  One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.

In his father's footsteps, Jacob then became
Prince of God, a wrestler, Israel his name;
By the Spirit's dealing, fully grown, he reigned;
O'er the earth, through Joseph, ruling pow'r obtained.

  Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
  One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.

Thus do Jacob, Isaac, Abraham portray
Path that we, God's called ones, must walk in today:
Members of the Body, as a corporate man,
We complete His calling and fulfill His plan.

  Our Lord God Jehovah called a corporate man,
  One that would express Him and fulfill His plan.--------1270
We are the Hebrews! Praise the Lord!
We're from the other side.
Throughout our hist'ry we have passed
Through rivers deep and wide.

  Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  He has brought
  All us river-crossing Hebrews
  To the land, to build up
  The temple of our God.

Old Noah's age was so corrupt,
In deep depravity;
So Noah passed across the flood
That separating sea.

  Praise the Lord! He has brought
  From the old
  To a new recovered region
  Where he built in this land
  An altar for his God.

Then Abraham was called apart,
For God to take a stand;
So through the river he was led
Into a new, good land.

  Step by step he was led
  From Chaldee
  Through the river into Canaan,
  That good land, there to be
  The servant of his God.

The Israelites in bondage were
To Pharaoh's choking hand.
The God of Hebrews made a way
For them to leave that land.

  Through the sea, they all passed;
  Egypt fell,
  Hallelujah! In the good land
  They built up God's own house
  To satisfy His heart.

Then wand'ring through the wilderness,
The land they could not find;
Till through the Jordan they did pass
To leave themselves behind.

  Praise the Lord! In the land
  They built up
  God's own temple. Hallelujah!
  Praise the Lord! There they dwelt,
  His people and their God.

But then religion conquered all,
So John the Baptist came
And buried all beneath that flood.
The Jews were not the same.

  Buried all! Buried all!
  Buried all!
  Underneath the Jordan River
  Buried all to become
  The Hebrews passing through.

Now in the church life, we have left
The world, religion too;
Now we're the river-crossing ones,
Enjoying Christ so new!

  Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  We have passed
  From the oldness, Hallelujah,
  Into Christ  one new man.
  And now we're one with Him!

O Lord, You've taken us across
The fiery sea of glass,
With all the worldly things beneath;
Across the sea we've passed.

  Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
  Now we stand
  As the Hebrews, Hallelujah,
  On the sea! Praise the Lord!
  We've passed through everything!--------1271
We're the river-crossers, Hebrews is our name;
Crossed the Euphrates, idols all are slain.
Entered into Canaan, left the other side;
Seeking a city, which shall e'er abide.

  We are the Hebrews, that's our real name;
  We've crossed the river, we are not the same.
  Building God's house that He may dwell on earth,
  Building God's house that He may dwell on earth.

We were bound in Egypt, building for the foe;
God of the Hebrews said, "Let My people go!"
We have crossed the Red Sea, reached the other side;
Pharaoh, his army, perished in the tide.

  God of the Hebrews, speak again today;
  God of the Hebrews, lead us all the way.
  Save all Your people from this crooked age,
  Save all Your people from this crooked age

We're released, and now we build the house of God;
His tabernacle is our true abode.
Forty years of oldness left in Jordan's tide,
Fight we for Canaan on the kingdom side.

  Salvation's Captain sounds the trump of war;
  City by city, take we more and more,
  To gain His kingdom, enter into rest,
  To gain His kingdom, enter into rest.

What was once God-given soon a form became;
Then John the Baptist did God's word proclaim
Make another crossing, God is going on;
Judaism's over; listen to My Son!

  Turn from the prophets, turn unto the Son;
  He's My Beloved, He and I are one;
  His Word will save you to the uttermost,
  His Word will save you to the uttermost.

Now we're overcomers on the sea of glass;
This final crossing will forever last.
Sing the song of Moses, make the praise complete,
Look! All our enemies beneath our feet.

  We're overcomers, that's our real name.
  God has His city; Satan gets the shame.
  God is our portion for eternity,
  God is our portion for eternity.--------1272
The birthright God has giv'n to us
Must be our goal, our highest prize,
For we're the church of the first-born
Let us our portion realize!

A double portion of the land
Was Joseph's birthright  and 'tis ours
If we our garments keep from sin,
And stay pure in temptation's hour.

The priesthood was to Levi giv'n
As his inheritance  for he
Did count his family ties but loss
And owned God's things supreme to be.

The kingship, Judah did receive
For tending to young Joseph's need;
Through Benjamin's adversity,
He was his comforter indeed.

The double portion we would seek,
The priesthood and the kingship too;
Make us so desperate, Lord, for Thee
That Thee, our birthright, we'd pursue.

We would be those who pay the price,
Deny the soul, reject the self;
Ambitious for the birthright thus
We'd gain Thee, Lord, above all else.

The promise, Lord, 'twas giv'n to us,
Oh, let us ne'er this right despise;
Enflame us, Lord, to gain Thyself,
And Thee, our birthright realize.--------1273
Christ has called us once to Him,
But He calls us once again.
To His call we say Amen!
Overcome!
For the church has fallen low,
Thinking everything they know,
But the life is missing; so,
Overcome!

  Overcome! Overcome!
  Overcome degraded Christianity!
  All your working lay aside,
  All the teachings that divide;
  Eat the Lord whate'er betide
  Overcome!

Eating is man's destiny
And the Lord's recovery;
This defeats the enemy
Overcome!
Come enjoy the tree of life,
Leave the doctrines, leave the strife!
Overcome by eating Christ
Overcome!

  Overcome! Overcome!
  Overcome degraded Christianity!
  All your working lay aside,
  All the teachings that divide;
  Eat the Lord whate'er betide
  Overcome!

Teachings ne'er transform the soul,
Teachings never reach God's goal,
Eating Christ will do it all
Overcome!
We must overcome to eat,
By ourselves and when we meet,
Eat Him as the feast complete
Overcome!

  Overcome! Overcome!
  Overcome degraded Christianity!
  All your working lay aside,
  All the teachings that divide;
  Eat the Lord whate'er betide
  Overcome!

Eating gives the manchild birth,
Eating brings the Lord to earth;
Eat Him now midst all the dearth
Overcome!
Be the manchild Christ requires,
Thus the church that He desires,
Then the Bride that He admires
Overcome!

  Overcome! Overcome!
  Overcome degraded Christianity!
  All your working lay aside,
  All the teachings that divide;
  Eat the Lord whate'er betide
  Overcome!--------1274
Revelation 2-3

In Revelation two and three,
The seven local churches see:
The lessons there for you and me
Are for the Lord's recovery.

The words to them are words to us,
So that the church be glorious,
And all their warnings we must heed
So that the Lord can meet His need.

To Ephesus, the word is clear:
"To your first love you're not so near;
You've left to work so far away;
Repent, return to Him today."

Thus, we must all turn back to Him,
Leave other loves, for these are sin.
Oh, let us hearken to His call
If we miss this, we've missed it all!

Then unto Smyrna, suffering, sore
"You have been tried, but something more
Be faithful unto death," we're told
(Not just of body but of soul).

Be faithful 'til what's natural dies;
Your circumstances don't despise;
The Lord has sent them all to you
To prove that your first love is true.

From Pergamos we clearly see
The world has wed Christianity!
And faithful Antipas did fall
He dared to stand against it all.

To wed the world we all must fear:
His spoken word will save us here
If to His speaking we give heed,
We'll separated be indeed.

Then Thyatira comes at length:
Her mixture with the world her strength.
Fine flour leavened by the yeast,
A harlot riding on a beast.

10 Lord, we are mixed but hardly know;
To us this mixture fully show.
Each added thing we will refute
Until we're wholly absolute.

11 And then from Sardis, we can know
Life is the way that we must go!
She says she's living, but she's dead;
She needs to touch the Lord instead.

12 Lord, take us all the way to life
To overcome the deadness rife.
Away from deadness we would flee
That full of life we'll always be.

13 Now Philadelphia comes at last;
That which she has she should hold fast
The brothers' love, the name, the word;
This church has satisfied the Lord.

14 We as the brothers all are one;
We're one by life, and life alone.
If we His word and name do keep
A glorious building God will reap.

15 Laodicea warns us all:
From Philadelphia some will fall.
By saying, "I am rich," it's then
The Lord is outside wanting in.

16 Lukewarmness we must ever spurn
And in the spirit always burn,
The inward life experience gain,
And pay the price with Him to reign.

17 Lord, shine Your light on us today
That we may fully go Your way;
Anoint our eyes and let us see
So You can have recovery.--------1275
Revelation 3:17-13

Glorious things of thee are spoken,
Philadelphia, church of love.
These things saith the One who's holy,
He who's real speaks from above;
He that has the key of David,
Who the kingdom's entrance won,
"I will open, no man shutteth"
He has spoken; it is done.

Hallelujah, Philadelphia,
Thine are works that please the Lord.
Strength thou hast, though just a little
And hast kept His living Word.
Thou His holy name denied not,
But confessed it here below
Lo, a door is set before thee,
Through which none but thee can go.

Thou, beloved Philadelphia,
Dost His Word of patience keep.
From the hour of trial He'll save thee,
Which o'er all the world shall sweep.
Troublers too shall know He loves thee;
They to thee must then bow down.
"Hold thou fast, for I come quickly,
That no man may take thy crown."

Hallelujah, overcomers,
"In the temple of My God,
I will build them in as pillars,
Nevermore to go abroad."
God's own name is written on them
And the new name of the Lord.
With the triune God they're blended;
They're the city of our God.

Hallelujah, out of heaven,
Comes the New Jerusalem:
Gates of pearl and walls of jasper,
Mingled with each precious gem.
Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
Has become His Bride so dear.
Now the Spirit in the churches
Speaks to all who have an ear.--------1276
Revelation 3:7-13

Oh, the Lord is quickly coming,
He has spoken in His Word;
And confirmed it by the churches,
For His Spirit we have heard.

Not to all the seven churches
Did the Lord speak in this way;
To the church in Philadelphia
Did He choose these words to say.

Philadelphia, Philadelphia,
Church so full of brotherly love,
You're the church to bring the Bridegroom
Back to earth from heav'n above.

He that hath the key of David,
He that shuts and opens too,
Knows thy works, O Philadelphia;
That's why you're His Bride so true.

Not so strong by worldly standards,
Hidden from religion's fame;
Jesus loves you, Philadelphia,
For you're faithful to His name.

By His Word you're overcoming
How the Amen does resound!
Just hold fast to what you've gotten,
That no man may take your crown.

You have kept His Word of patience;
He will keep you from that hour
Which upon the whole world cometh
When the Lord comes in His power.

"I come quickly," Philadelphia,
Speaks the Lord to none but you;
"Amen! Quickly come, Lord Jesus,"
Answer back His faithful few.--------1277
Now in all the churches flowing,
Brotherly love.
Light and life and love bestowing,
Brotherly love.
In the oneness all believing,
Fellowship with all receiving,
Nevermore the Spirit grieving,
Brotherly love.

To maintain the sweet communion,
Brotherly love;
Fellowship and healing union,
Brotherly love.
Love believing for the brothers,
Hoping all things for the others,
Suffering all with one another,
Brotherly love.

For the issue of fruit bearing,
Brotherly love.
Fellowship in oneness sharing,
Brotherly love.
Here our soul life we're forsaking,
And the Spirit's way we're taking,
Now from death to life we're breaking,
Brotherly love.

Oh, this perfect way of gladness,
Brotherly love!
No more fear, imparting sadness,
Brotherly love!
Now is our sure affirmation,
Life and Spirit our foundation,
Building up, the consummation
Brotherly love.

Seed of life within us growing,
Brotherly love.
Philadelphia now is flowing,
Brotherly love.
To this love God has restored us;
Everything will fall before us;
Love is over all victorious,
Brotherly love!--------1278
In the church of Jesus there is love for you,
Love most pure and tender, love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely, why for friendship sigh,
When the church of Jesus has a full supply?

In the church of Jesus there is life for you,
Warm as summer sunshine, sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful, why take anxious thought,
Since the church of Jesus cares for those He bought?

In the church of Jesus there is work for you;
Such as even angels might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing for some life work grand,
While the church of Jesus seeks your reaping hand?

In the church of Jesus there's a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous, right and peaceful too;
Why then like a wand'rer, roam with weary pace,
If the church of Jesus holds for you a place.--------1279
What we are, we're His image;
We're created in His image,
To express the Christ, subdue the earth,
The purpose of our second birth,
We're His image, glorious!

What we are, we're the called ones,
We've been called into the purpose.
No longer low in Adam's fall,
God's glory is our holy call.
We're the called ones, glorious!

What we are, we're the joint-heirs;
We inherit full salvation.
We overcome and share His throne.
All things today we fully own.
We're the joint-heirs, glorious!

What we are, we're Christ's partners:
We share the same anointing.
No longer we're just serving Him;
His riches we may all share in.
We're His partners glorious!

What we are, we're the brothers.
We are all the holy brothers.
The life of Christ we did obtain,
For holiness the gold we gain.
Holy brothers, glorious!

What we are, we're the lampstand;
We're the shining forth of Jesus.
In this world's darkness, sin, and strife,
We're holding Christ, the light of life.
We're the lampstand, glorious.--------1280
We've become the Lord's dear brothers
Through His resurrection pow'r;
He desires many brothers
Sharing in His triumph hour!

  Jesus is our Elder Brother,
  First-born of God's sons is He;
  He came forth in resurrection,
  From religion He is free!
  As His church we come together;
  Oldness, form, and self deny;
  Just to meet with our Big Brother,
  Him alone to glorify!

In our Brother's resurrection
Resurrected we must meet,
Never in our natural standing
This will make His joy complete!

  Jesus is our Elder Brother,
  First-born of God's sons is He;
  He came forth in resurrection,
  From religion He is free!
  As His church we come together;
  Oldness, form, and self deny;
  Just to meet with our Big Brother,
  Him alone to glorify!

Every day we must see Jesus
As we're eating of the Word;
Then we'll run to all the meetings
Burning, bubbling with the Lord!

  Jesus is our Elder Brother,
  First-born of God's sons is He;
  He came forth in resurrection,
  From religion He is free!
  As His church we come together;
  Oldness, form, and self deny;
  Just to meet with our Big Brother,
  Him alone to glorify!

In the meetings we are feasting
On the food unlimited.
Jesus always satisfies us,
Feeding us the living bread!

  Jesus is our Elder Brother,
  First-born of God's sons is He;
  He came forth in resurrection,
  From religion He is free!
  As His church we come together;
  Oldness, form, and self deny;

  Him alone to glorify!

We would satisfy our Brother,
Even though our portion's small.
Every one must share his "new dish"
For the benefit of all!

  Jesus is our Elder Brother,
  First-born of God's sons is He;
  He came forth in resurrection,
  From religion He is free!
  As His church we come together;
  Oldness, form, and self deny;

Not for message or for speaker,
But to meet the Lord we're here;
Caring only for His presence,
We would see our Brother dear!

Can also use tune of #325

All the meetings Christ appointed
And attended here on earth
Were apart from all religion,
All its rituals, forms, and dearth.
Resurrection, not religion,
Must be our reality;
Let us meet in resurrection,
From all dead religion free.

When the Lord was resurrected,
All religious things were through;
Christ is now our living temple,
Christ is all our offerings too.
With our Lord in resurrection,
Hallelujah, we're released!
Pity all the old religion
All our meetings are a feast!

Yet religion  oh, how subtle
In our blood is hiding out;
God must give us revelation,
All that unseen monster rout.
Lord, we still are too religious
Down with our religious soul!
We would all release our spirit,
Let each meeting reach the goal.

In the meetings, in the meetings,
On the mountain, at the shore,
Jesus, Jesus, living Jesus,
He is here  what want we more?
Bury all the old religion,
Even Christianity
Jesus, Jesus, we have Jesus,
He is our reality!--------1282
Marching on, marching on, in the Spirit marching on;
Hallelujah! the churches march on.
Marching on, marching on, in the Spirit marching on;
Hallelujah! the churches march on.

  In the church we see
  The Lord's recovery
  And for it the Spirit seven-strong.
  The world will know,
  Wherever we shall go,
  That in our age the Lord's marching on!--------1283
Fight, saints, for Jesus our Lord!
Take in His life, stand in one accord!
Never fear God's enemy;
Tread on his head triumphantly!
Pray that the daily church life be strong,
That all the saints in spirit press on,
Fighting as the one new man,
Fulfilling our Lord's great plan!
(Glory! Hallelujah!)--------1284
Our eyes have seen the vision:
The goal is now in view,
Christ has defeated Satan,
And sin and death are through.
The way is cut and open,
The paths are all made straight;
We've heard the call: Come forward!
We've laid aside each weight.

  Come forward! Come forward!
  Our Christ is on the throne.
  His ministry, so heavenly,
  Brings all  brings all the fighters home.

Our eyes have seen the vision
Since Christ our conquering King
Has called us to the battle,
Which He did surely win.
The vict'ry He bequested
Two thousand years ago
To all the glorious fighters
Who'll forward with Him go.

  Come forward! Come forward!
  Our Christ is on the throne.
  His ministry, so heavenly,
  Brings all  brings all the fighters home.

Our eyes have seen the vision.
Our Captain leads us on.
To press into our spirit,
To share with Him the throne.
Lord, Thou hast giv'n Thy soldiers
The pow'r to wield the sword,
And made us glorious fighters
Through Spirit, church, and Word.

  Come forward! Come forward!
  Our Christ is on the throne.
  His ministry, so heavenly,
  Brings all  brings all the fighters home.--------1285
The faith which once for all was giv'n
Unto the saints of old,
Has been committed unto us
To guard, defend, and hold.

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.

This good deposit is the mark
Of God's economy,
Without it we will miss the aim
Of His recovery.

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.

The myst'ry of the common faith,
A conscience pure requires;
A holy, separated life
For us the Lord desires.

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.

This outline of the healthy words,
In faith and love we'll hold;
All different teaching, fruitless talk,
Reject with spirit bold.

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.

Oh, healthful teaching, wholesome words:
The truth of godliness!
Oh, good deposit, common faith,
And life of holiness!

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.

Lord, make us now those faithful men
Who pass on what we've heard;
Make us examples of the saints
In spirit, faith, and word.

  And we know whom we have believd
  And are persuaded that He is able
  To guard, through the Holy Spirit,
  Our deposit to that day.--------1286
The Lord has shown the way
Within the church today
It's laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.
Christ is the Canaan land;
In Him we boldly stand,
While laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.

  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander  On!
  We'll move at His command
  And now possess the land
  Through laboring, laboring, laboring on Christ.

The way that God has planned
To labor on the land
Is "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"
Whene'er He speaks today,
Whatever He may say,
It's "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"

  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander  On!
  We'll move at His command
  And now possess the land
  By "Amen, Lord! Amen, Lord! Amen to Your Word!"

The Lord has also shown
The land we'll fully own
By following, following, following the church.
Where'er the Body goes,
Howe'er the Spirit flows,
It's following, following, following the church.

  On to victory! On to victory!
  Cries our great Commander  On!
  We'll move at His command
  And now possess the land
  By following, following, following the church.--------1287
Let's take the land! The land that God has given us;
In all our living, Christ can be so much;
To take this land, we have th' equipment that we need
The blood, the Word, the Spirit, and the church.

In Eden's garden, Satan thought
He'd wreck the Lord's intention.
And so, conspiring, then, he wrought
His subtle intervention.
To man he entered in,
Became indwelling sin,
And by this deed so bad
He really thought he had
Undone the Lord completely.

'Twas all according to God's plan
To trap the Devil, Satan.
His sphere of moving narrowed now,
Man's flesh his habitation;
Though brilliant was his plan
To enter into man,
This man became instead
The means to bruise his head,
And finish him forever.

So Christ put on our human flesh
An act of wisdom purely.
And on the cross did thus enmesh
His foe held so securely.
Though desperate Satan's plight
He fought with all his might;
But when the morning came
Christ was alive again,
And Satan crushed forever.--------1289
The vict'ry's won! The Lord has triumphed o'er the foe!
The vict'ry shout is heard afar and near!
His blood prevails! It giveth us the victory!
And soon the mighty Victor will appear.

  The vict'ry's won! This shout we raise!
  In Zion's city, proclaim His vict'ry
  Till all the earth is filled with praise.

  Brothers sing
  The vict'ry's won! O Christian sisters,
  The mighty work of Christ is done!
  The Lord victorious has conquered for us
  Eternal joys have now begun.

The vict'ry's won! We've overcome the enemy.
The Word of God we boldly testify.
God speaks His Word  in it there's life and liberty
And by the Word the devil we defy.

  Sisters sing
  The vict'ry's won! O Christian brothers,
  The vict'ry's won! This shout we raise!
  In Zion's city, proclaim His vict'ry
  Till all the earth is filled with praise.

O Lord, we've seen Your purpose to bring the many sons
To share in Your full glory and see Your kingdom come.
We praise You, Lord, this glory is You, Yourself within,
Spread out in all Your people to shine in all of them.

Since we received Your life, Lord, a seed's been growing there:
The seed of inward glory, the glory we will share!
By growing 'til the blossom of glory blooms in full,
We'll thus enjoy Your increase and glory bountiful.

Hail! Captain of Salvation! Our heav'nly Pioneer!
Our praises, midst the battle and tumult, You will hear.
We're following our Captain all through the mighty fray.
Our glorious, faithful Captain sustains us all the way.

Lord, fighting on to glory, You now have gone before;
Now fighting in Your footsteps we'll conquer o'er and o'er.
From glory unto glory, we'll fight until we see
The glory from within us shall manifested be.

Then, Lord, at last the fighting and battle cry will cease,
And we'll appear in glory, Your kingdom and increase.
That day we'll be completed, that day Your face we'll see,
For in that blessed day, Lord, we'll in the glory be!--------1291
Luke 22:31-32

At the end of Luke's gospel, chapter twenty and two,
The Lord says to Peter, "Satan wants to sift you,"
But the Lord's interceding and His prayer is true,
Hallelujah! He's prayed for us, we'll never sift through!

  Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
  And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
  Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
  He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.

Just a Christian alone, however strong he may be
Cannot withstand the sifting of the Lord's enemy;
Though he might sift one only, yet he'll ne'er sift two,
Hallelujah! Together we're too big to sift through!

  Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
  And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
  Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
  He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.

What wonderful purpose God has purposed for us,
To be transformed and reigning with His Son, glorious;
So it just doesn't matter what the foe might do
Hallelujah! The church is much too big to sift through!

  Though there's all kinds of battles in our living each day,
  And we always face trials, life is ordered that way,
  Still, in all situations, as He intercedes,
  He in all things supplies us and meets all of our needs.--------1292
An uplifted gospel have we,
One we're not ashamed to proclaim.
Our gospel's the highest of all,
For it is God's goal and God's aim.
No longer so lowly and poor,
We've found that we're God's holy sons.
No more will we preach as before;
Now each man on earth can be won.

Our Brother's inherited all
God made Him to rule His affairs
Appointed  this office He fills
And shares it with us, His joint-heirs.
Elected before earth was formed,
We've found that we are qualified
To share all His glory and worth.
How could men but for Christ decide?

Yes, we're holy brothers with Christ,
No higher could any man be.
This highest of all gospels is;
This gospel each human must see.
Partakers of this heavenly call,
Could any this gospel reject?
With Christ sitting far above all
This highest of all gospels yet!--------1293
O I'm a man
I'm the meaning of the universe;
Yes, I'm a man
I'm the meaning of the universe.
God made me such,
I am so much;
I'm the center and the meaning of the universe.

Christ lives in me
He's the meaning of my human life;
Christ lives in me
He's the meaning of my human life.
Yes, He's in me
My all to be;
He's the meaning and reality of my human life.

The church is Christ
His expression on the earth today;
The church is Christ
His expression on the earth today.
This corporate man,
Fulfills God's plan,
That this man may have dominion over all the earth.

The local church
It's the new and real family life;
The local church
It's the new and real family life.
We have the way
To live today
Eating, drinking Christ we're built up as the local church.

What shall we do?
We should go and tell the world of this.
What shall we do?
We should go and tell the world of this.
Disciple all
This is our call.
Let us go and spread the news abroad to every land.--------1294
Come let us speak till the kingdom of the Lord comes down.
Yes, let us speak till the kingdom of the Lord comes down.
Why hold your peace?
The Word release.
Let us speak until the kingdom of the Lord comes down.

Oh, loose the Word! It shall not return unto Him void.
Yes, loose the Word! It shall not return unto Him void.
Let's sow the seed,
This is our need;
Loose the Word, and it shall not return unto Him void!

It's gospel time! Let us spread the gospel all around.
Yes, gospel time! We will never fear the people's frown!
God's done His work;
Let us not shirk;
We're but pilgrims here, and we'll not fear the people's frown!

If we will speak, Christ will witness in the hearts of men.
If we will speak, Christ will witness in the hearts of men.
Tell every man,
Win all we can.
Through our speaking, Christ is speaking in the hearts of men!

The harvest's ripe! We are preaching the full gospel now!
The fields are white! We are preaching the full gospel now!
For this men search
Christ and the church!
Let us reap the harvest, preaching the full gospel now!--------1295
Philippians 1

Ours is a fellowship in the gospel
Since we received the Lord;
We're for the furtherance of the gospel,
Spreading to all His Word.
For its defense and strong confirmation
We all partake of grace
He who began this work will perfect it
Till we shall see His face.

May all the things that come to us daily
Unto the gospel turn,
That all may see we're bound for the gospel
And of the Lord may learn.
May we be bold and fearless in spirit,
Speaking the Word of God,
Do it in love and do it in power,
While living in the Lord.

Lord, we're expecting that we'll be given
Boldness with every breath.
Christ must be magnified in our body
Whether by life or death.
We hope in nothing to be ashamed,
For us to live is Christ
He is the Person in all our living,
Our everything, our life.

May all our lives be worthy the gospel
Whatever may betide,
All standing fast in oneness of spirit,
All striving side by side.
Let us proclaim the gospel in fullness
To satisfy the Lord:
Christ is the life, the church His expression,
Sound everywhere abroad.--------1296
The universe of God consists
Of heaven, earth, and air.
The enemy of God resists
His purpose everywhere.
At first the mighty rebel one
The earth from God obtained;
Then from the Lord the air had won,
Establishing his reign.

So God's intention was to gain
His kingdom on the earth,
The place where He could fully reign
And show to all His worth.
Thus He began in Genesis
To forward His great plan.
Out of this darkened, lost abyss
Our God created man.

But Satan caused the man to fall
From God's eternal grace.
Then Abraham received the call
To head the chosen race.
The Jews were led from Pharaoh's hand
Through sea and wilderness
Into the promised Canaan land,
God's kingdom to express.

The Israelites refused God's reign,
Desired an earthly king;
The kingdom then was lost again
Till David was to bring
God's kingdom back to earth once more
For God to rule through him;
But Israel failed as once before
God's kingdom to bring in.

Such was the situation when
Our God became a man,
Declaring to all men, "Repent!
The kingdom is at hand."
A perfect model of God's rule,
The King, full qualified!
But Satan as a desperate fool
Had Jesus crucified.

This Jesus went into the grave
And death He overcame.
Now resurrected He will save
The earth from Satan's reign.
He as the Spirit enters man
To fill him with His life.
These men, the church, fulfill His plan
To save the earth from strife.

Now on the earth the church we see,
God's kingdom here expressed,
Where He has full authority
His rule to manifest.
The place where Satan has to flee
Our mighty conquering rod,
The kingdom through the church will be
Brought to the earth for God.--------1297
From the beachhead in our spirit
To our mind, emotion, will.
Christ will spread through all our being
And our vessel wholly fill.
He will cast out all rebellion,
Change our darkness into light.
Satan's kingdom will be swallowed,
And Christ will reign with might.
This is the Lord's recovery,
This is His very best!
Brothers, give the Lord the ground in you
Till His kingdom's manifest.--------1298
Chosen by God in ages past,
Our God will never let us go;
Salvation is assured fore'er;
'Tis such security we know.

"I give to them eternal life,
They shall not perish," is His word;
"No one shall snatch them from Our hands,"
This is the promise of the Lord.

Yet there's a word for God's own sons,
Which is a warning from the Lord:
For those not ready when He comes,
"Worse punishment" and not "reward."

Reward is not eternal life,
It's based on how we run the race;
It all depends on what we build,
It's not a matter, here, of grace.

'Tis for God's kingdom we press on,
Like Moses, we are for the Lord;
We suffer with God's people here
And look away to the reward.

Richer by far, reproach of Christ,
Than Egypt's treasures, which are sin;
By faith we leave Egyptian land,
Avoiding next age discipline.

Our soul gained for the kingdom's age
For this we lose our soul life here;
If we lay down our soul life now,
We'll save it for Christ's kingdom there.

We all must learn to pay the price,
Christ must be worked into our soul;
'Tis thus our soul is gained by Him,
This is our aim and this our goal.--------1299
Man's Creator has a purpose
For our being here on earth.
In His image we're created,
To express His rule on earth.
But man fell to Satan's tempting;
Thus God's goal was hid from view.
Still our God will have His kingdom,
For His Son will see it through.

Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
Notwithstanding Satan's plans;
He's obtaining something real by
Growing in the hearts of man.
Nothing like religion teaches:
"You must wait until you die"
For the kingdom Christ is building,
Is on earth before our eyes.

His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
Once in human form He came.
Now as Spirit He can enter
As the breath of life to man.
As a seed within our spirit
Christ takes root and starts to grow,
Spreading in our inmost being
Till His life we come to know.

Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it,
Christ is longing for His Bride.
We can hasten His returning
Simply by the growth in life.
No more struggling, no more striving,
Simply turn to Christ within.
See the seed begin to blossom,
Growing fully into Him.

Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
Just by growth  the normal way.
Not an instant transformation;
Growth goes on from day to day.
This life-seed is all-inclusive
Everything we'll ever need;
Yes, our God's eternal purpose
Is within this precious seed.--------1300
The Lord has been revealed in us,
The kingdom-seed so glorious;
He's planted deeper than our heart,
And from us He will ne'er depart.
This seed is never satisfied
Just in our spirits to abide;
He wants to grow and spread today
To live in us in every way.

We're like a glove, an empty man,
So meaningless without a hand;
Lord, saturate each inward part
And form Yourself in all our heart.
The Lord must spread into our mind,
Our natural thoughts and concepts bind;
Imaginations, dreams be gone,
The kingdom-seed in us is sown!

In our emotions He must grow;
Raw, fragile feelings overthrow;
Our love, our hatred, must be His
Lord, we agree with You for this.
Another part the Lord must fill
Our hard, unbending, stubborn will;
Lord, our resistance quickly break,
Subdue us for Thy kingdom's sake.

Our conscience too the Lord must clear,
That we may walk in godly fear;
Our conscience must be keen today,
Else we cannot the Lord obey.
'Tis by His growing, spreading thus,
The Lord will have His home in us;
A place on earth where He is Lord,
Full rights to Him we will afford.--------1301
Jesus the kingdom has come into us,
Reigning and shining He's all glorious,
Christ as the seed is the King who has come,
Into our spirit His kingdom He's sown.

  O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
  His kingdom life be all we know.
  Jesus, the kingdom is sown into us;
  Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!

We must repent for the kingdom's at hand;
All that we do, think, or feel, or have planned
Must be abandoned and changed in our mind;
Leave all the world and self-seeking behind.

  O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
  His kingdom life be all we know.
  Jesus, the kingdom is sown into us;
  Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!

All of religion has missed it again,
Teaching for doctrines the concepts of men;
They vainly wait for the kingdom to be,
A dispensation they're hoping to see.

  O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
  His kingdom life be all we know.
  Jesus, the kingdom is sown into us;
  Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!

But now the kingdom to us has been shown,
It is no less than our Jesus alone.
It is the Person of Christ in us all,
And it begins as a seed when we call.

  O let Him grow, O let Him grow;
  His kingdom life be all we know.
  Jesus, the kingdom is sown into us;
  Jesus, the kingdom, O how glorious!--------1302
Matthew 25:1-13

All the signs point to the end,
Christ soon will be here again;
We must be ready for Him
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!

From soul and self turn away,
Look unto Jesus today;
There is no time to delay
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!

Foolish ones never will turn;
When the Lord comes they will learn
There is no oil left to burn
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!

Wise virgins buy up the time;
Never drunk with the world's wine,
Filled in the spirit they shine
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!

Let us go forth unto Him,
Not only with our lamps trimmed,
Buy the oil now lest they dim
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!

Jesus is now on His way,
Watch, for you know not the day;
Ever in His presence stay
Jesus is coming again!

  Coming again, coming again,
  Time is swiftly passing by,
  Soon we may hear the midnight cry!
  Coming again, coming again,
  As the wise virgins we must be prepared!
  Jesus is coming again!--------1303
Matthew 25:1-13

The kingdom of God is at hand:
Ten virgins with lamps lit arise
To go forth to meet the Bridegroom,
But only five virgins are wise.
The wise have abundance of oil,
The foolish are empty instead;
The wise used their time to buy oil,
The others their chance forfeited.

Lord Jesus, Thy message is clear:
You're coming for those who are wise,
Who buy up their oil today,
Who deal with all hindering ties.
Those virgins whose souls are transformed,
Whose vessels much oil contain,
Who love not their lives unto death
They in Thy great kingdom shall reign.

Our lamps to shine forth must be trimmed
By calling on Thee every day.
In spirit we must exercise
To burn all the oldness away.
But there is a much deeper need:
Reality in us must grow,
Until it make home in our hearts,
Till oil in our vessels o'erflows.

We see how this age is so dark,
We know that blest hour is near.
Our Lord may return anytime
Lord, strike in us this holy fear,
That we may each moment redeem
By taking Thy Word in by prayer,
By learning each lesson You give,
And thus for that hour prepare.

Lord Jesus, how blest to be those
Who bring in Thy kingdom to earth,
Affording Thee rule over all
And showing to all Thy great worth!
How blest to be those at the feast,
Where Thou wilt be one with Thy Bride!
Lord, make us wise virgins for Thee,
Who e'er in Thy presence abide.--------1304
Matthew 25, Revelation 14

  And the Spirit you apply,

Our faith to God-ward must in these days spread abroad.
To show we've turned from idols to the living God.
We'll mix His Word with faith by answering "Amen!"
And to Christ in the Word turn again and again.

  Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
  The labor of our love increase abundantly,
  His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
  While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.

The love for all the brothers, in our midst is found,
But in these days our love must increase and abound.
The Lord direct our hearts into the love of God
And prepare us in full for the day of the Lord.

  Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
  The labor of our love increase abundantly,
  His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
  While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.

Our spirit, soul, and body wholly sanctified
Our faithful Lord will do it to prepare His Bride,
While we amen His voice in matters great or small,
That we all may be ready to hear Jesus' call.

  Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
  The labor of our love increase abundantly,
  His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
  While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.

The Lord Himself shall come, and we shall be with Him
Oh, what a glorious hope! Come quickly, Lord, Amen.
We'd ever watchful be to see Thee in the air
And as sons of the day for that meeting prepare.

  Our work of faith must grow exceedingly,
  The labor of our love increase abundantly,
  His sanctifying work in us go on and on,
  While in patience of hope we will watch till He comes.--------1306
We love Thy coming, Lord!
We know not when 'twill be,
But turn from all distracting things
Thine own dear face to see.

We serve the living God
And wait His Son to see;
For this we need faith, love, and hope,
Increasing constantly.

In Thy dear presence, Lord,
We hope we all may be
A crown of glory and a joy
To those we then shall see.

We love Thy coming, Lord;
The time is very nigh.
Our hearts unblameable must be
To greet Thee from on high.

The Lord Himself shall come
With loud assembling word,
And all the saints in Christ shall be
Forever with the Lord.

We're children of the day,
We're children of the light;
That day should never come to us
As does a thief at night.

Lord, wholly sanctify
And blameless let us be
In spirit, soul, and body too
For that blest day with Thee.--------1307
The day approaches; Jesus soon is coming.
Redeem the time; it must not slip away.
Lord, make us ready for the cry: "Behold Him!"
By using every moment of each day.

  When Jesus comes, will we go in to meet Him?
  When Jesus comes, will we from self have ceased?
  He's coming soon to take the wise ones with Him.
  Oh, let us not be left outside the feast.

Lord, help us to redeem these golden moments;
Our vessels fill with ointment from above;
Help us amen each trial and tribulation;
Increase in us; make us abound in love.

  He's coming soon  these moments are so precious.
  The oil is here  Oh, let us buy the more.
  Amen the trials and welcome tribulations
  The kingdom's ours through these afflictions sore.

Lord, ever turn us from our soulish pleasures
To gaze upon Thy tender, loving face.
Oh, keep us running forth to meet the Bridegroom
And patiently attending to the race.

  When Jesus comes, will we be in His presence?
  When Jesus comes, will we His face behold?
  Oh, let us not return to sloth and folly,
  But jealously His loving presence hold.

As His dear Bride, let us go forth to meet Him,
Our lamps well-trimmed, our fires burning bright,
Our vessels filled, our eyes set on His glory,
To be with Him completely satisfied.

  Yes, satisfied  Christ and His Bride together,
  Yes, satisfied  throughout eternity.
  Oh, what a rest, what joy, what love, what favor
  To be His Bride when He comes to His feast!--------1308
Matthew 25:1-13

We have oil in our lamps  we are burning!
We have oil in our lamps today!
To the spirit, O Lord, keep us turning,
Keep us turning, turning all the way!

  O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!
  We are burning, burning every day!
  O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!
  Turning, turning all the way!

But our vessels need oil for Thy coming;
We must gain a reserve supply.
So our vessels we give for the filling
That our lamps may never, never die.

  Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
  Every moment give us more of Thee!
  Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
  Fill us with reality!

Then we'll burn till the Lord comes to meet us,
Then we'll burn till He comes that day.
Then we'll go in with Him to the wedding
And be brightly burning all the way.

  Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
  Come and find us filled and burning bright!
  Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
  Come and in Thy Bride delight.--------1309
Who can tell how soon the Bride may hear the cry,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Hear the shout of triumph ringing in the sky,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

Who will have their lamps all trimmed and burning bright?
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Extra oil have ready should you hear tonight,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

Who will now be washed by water in the Word?
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Spots and wrinkles cleanse before the shout is heard,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

Who will be the counterpart to Christ today?
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Ready be to match Him now without delay,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

Who will now be clothed in linen bright and pure?
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Acts of righteousness will make her rapture sure,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

Hark! As one the Spirit and the Bride doth say,
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"
Brothers, sisters, this may be the wedding day!
"Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"

  We can almost see His glory in the sky;
  It must be the dawning of that day is nigh.
  How our hearts would leap if we should hear the cry,
  "Behold, the Bridegroom cometh!"--------1310
The Lord is longing for His Bride,
All glorious within.
His heart will then be satisfied
When she is fit for Him.

'Tis by the Word the church is made
Holy and pure as He;
All spots and wrinkles it removes
That she His Bride may be.

We must redeem these golden days,
Eating the Word in prayer,
Amening every line and phrase,
And thus for Him prepare.

Oh, how the Word doth penetrate,
Spirit and soul divide,
Revealing every hidden weight
For us to lay aside.

Lord, how we thank Thee for Thy Word,
Living and operative.
Oh, for Thy coming, we are stirred
Ever by it to live!

Lord, make us those who bring Thee back,
Who satisfy Thy heart.
Now by Thy Word supply our lack,
Make us Thy counterpart.--------1311
The local churches are preparing for the Lord's return
We know the time is near for our Bridegroom so dear.
He's coming back to claim the Bride for which His heart doth yearn,
That with Him we may be through all eternity.

  The Christ we love is coming soon,
  And He will come as our Bridegroom.
  We'll wait for Him, we'll watch and pray
  It may be today, it may be today!

How we must give Him all our heart and from all idols turn!
Oh, who else could there be who loves so tenderly?
Lord Jesus, You're the only One who makes our heart to burn
O please do not delay! Come quickly, e'en today!

  The Christ we love is coming soon,
  And He will come as our Bridegroom.
  We'll wait for Him, we'll watch and pray
  It may be today, it may be today!

A glorious Bride He is preparing for His wedding day;
She'll be so bright and pure, fine linen covering her.
O Lord, work in Thy righteousness, this is the only way;
And blessed we will be to join that feast with Thee.

  The Christ we love is coming soon,
  And He will come as our Bridegroom.
  We'll wait for Him, we'll watch and pray
  It may be today, it may be today!--------1312
It may be at morn as the day we are greeting;
It may be the time when the saints all are meeting;
But one thing we know, for the Spirit bears witness,
That Jesus will come very soon!

  O Lord Jesus, Amen!
  The church soon will see Thee again!
  "Thou art coming! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, Amen!
  Hallelujah, Amen!"

The days hasten by  there's no time for delaying;
So grasping each moment by watching and praying
And in everything giving thanks and rejoicing,
We'll welcome our Lord's return.

  O Lord Jesus, Amen!
  The church soon will see Thee again!
  "Thou art coming! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, Amen!
  Hallelujah, Amen!"

An instant, a twinkling, and Jesus descending
Will come for His saints in His glory transcending.
He'll come as the Bridegroom  as such we'll behold Him
To take to Himself His Bride!

  O Lord Jesus, Amen!
  The church soon will see Thee again!
  "Thou art coming! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, Amen!
  Hallelujah, Amen!"

What joy, what delight, when we finally meet Him!
The One whom we love  O what rapture to greet Him!
Our Lord and our life, our Beloved, our Bridegroom
Will take to Himself His Bride!

  O Lord Jesus, Amen!
  The church soon will see Thee again!
  "Thou art coming! Hallelujah!
  Hallelujah, Amen!
  Hallelujah, Amen!"--------1313
In that bright and golden moment when the Christ we love shall come,
And the radiance of His glory we shall see;
When the Bride shall meet the Bridegroom and His loving wife become,
What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!

  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting any moment we will share!

When to all who love His coming He shall speak the word, "Arise!"
Oh, how blessed for that summons to be free!
With what rapture we shall greet Him as we join Him in the skies
What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!

  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting any moment we will share!

Now in all the local churches we are meeting day by day
And expecting any moment Christ to see,
But when Jesus comes the meeting starts that ne'er will pass away
What a meeting, what a meeting that will be!

  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting any moment we will share!

Even now while we are meeting, Lord, we hope to see Thy face
And forever without ceasing be with Thee.
Then we'll just go right on meeting in another meeting place
What a meeting, what a meeting this will be!

  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting with our Lover, with our Bridegroom in the air!
  What a meeting, what a meeting,
  What a meeting any moment we will share!--------1314
Lord, Thou wilt soon appear,
Thy day is almost here.
Oh, how we love Thy coming soon!
We have no other
Lord, life, or lover
Than Thou, Lord Jesus, our Bridegroom!

The hour is drawing nigh,
Soon we shall hear Thy cry
And with Thee in the clouds descend.
Oh what an hour sweet
When Bride and Bridegroom meet
And love surpassing comprehend.

The moments fly apace,
Soon we shall see Thy face!
Amen, Lord Jesus! Quickly come!
We long Thyself to see
And with Thee ever be,
Thou who our inmost heart hath won.

'Tis but a moment now;
Thou, our Lord Bridegroom, Thou
Soon wilt return to claim Thy Bride.
O Hallelujah!
'Tis this we long for,
And Thou too wilt be satisfied.--------1315
Matthew 25:1-13

Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming,
And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
And lift up the glad new song.

  Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
  When the Christ we love shall come;
  With vessels filled and lamps all burning
  Let us welcome His return.
  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
  And the time will not be long
  Before we hail that wedding morning
  And lift up the glad new song.

Oh, let us now redeem each moment,
More the precious oil to buy,
And have our vessels filled with ointment
Ere we hear the midnight cry.

  Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
  When the Christ we love shall come;
  With vessels filled and lamps all burning
  Let us welcome His return.
  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
  And the time will not be long
  Before we hail that wedding morning
  And lift up the glad new song.

Oh, what a joy it is preparing
For our wedding with the Lord,
E'en in the tribulations sharing
For the bliss of such reward!

  Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
  When the Christ we love shall come;
  With vessels filled and lamps all burning
  Let us welcome His return.
  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
  And the time will not be long
  Before we hail that wedding morning
  And lift up the glad new song.

Oh, with what rapture and rejoicing
Shall the wedding day begin;
And then a thousand years of dining
At the marriage feast with Him!

  Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
  When the Christ we love shall come;
  With vessels filled and lamps all burning
  Let us welcome His return.
  Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom's coming
  And the time will not be long
  Before we hail that wedding morning
  And lift up the glad new song.--------1316
Our Bridegroom soon is coming
To claim His holy Bride,
The ones whom He has wooed, won,
And wholly sanctified.
O Lord, we would be ready
And get our hearts in tune
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon.

  Oh, the wedding day is coming,
  Is coming very soon,
  When the Bride shall be prepared
  And shall marry her Bridegroom.
  Oh, what love and consecration
  Should all our hearts attune
  For that wedding day that's coming
  Very soon.

Oh, that fine linen garment
Which on that day we'll wear
E'en now, Lord, work within us
And stitch by stitch prepare.
For this we would redeem
Every moment opportune
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon.

  Oh, the wedding day is coming,
  Is coming very soon,
  When the Bride shall be prepared
  And shall marry her Bridegroom.
  Oh, what love and consecration
  Should all our hearts attune
  For that wedding day that's coming
  Very soon.

Lord, may Your portion in us
Continually increase
That we may be invited
Unto that wedding feast.
And keep us always watching
At morning, night, or noon
For the wedding day that's coming
Very soon.

  Oh, the wedding day is coming,
  Is coming very soon,
  When the Bride shall be prepared
  And shall marry her Bridegroom.
  Oh, what love and consecration
  Should all our hearts attune
  For that wedding day that's coming
  Very soon.--------1317
When our Lord comes in glory and we're raptured to His side,
When that bright and glorious moment we shall see,
We shall know our dear Bridegroom as He comes to take His Bride,
And He'll know the Bride He's loved so tenderly.

  We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
  When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
  He shall know us! He shall know us!
  We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!

Even now in the Spirit He reveals Himself to us,
And His Person dear we've learned to recognize.
But our eyes shall behold Him  O what rapture glorious
When we gaze on Him unveiled in the skies!

  We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
  When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
  He shall know us! He shall know us!
  We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!

In the Word we have seen Him shining forth in truth and grace,
O how blessed to behold His features thus!
But the day soon is coming when we'll see Him face to face,
He, the living Word, in full revealed to us.

  We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
  When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
  He shall know us! He shall know us!
  We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!

In the brothers and sisters, O how blest to see the Lord,
In their attitudes and actions Christ expressed!
But the day soon is coming when in rapturous accord
We shall see His Person fully manifest.

  We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
  When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
  He shall know us! He shall know us!
  We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!

In the meetings of the churches He's unveiled increasingly
O the joy unspeakable and glory too!
As the meetings grow higher we're expecting soon to see
The full glory of our Lord come into view.

  We shall know Him! We shall know Him!
  When we see Him, our Bridegroom glorified!
  He shall know us! He shall know us!
  We're His church, His beloved, and His Bride!--------1318
Genesis 24

'Twas a day in early springtime,
By an ancient wayside well,
Eliezer paused to rest his camel train.
He had found a bride for Isaac
Ere the evening shadows fell,
For his weary journey had not been in vain.

  Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
  Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
  There's going to be a wedding,
  And our joy will soon begin,
  In the evening when the camel train comes in.

So he took the fair Rebekah,
Dressed in jewels rich and rare,
Quickly to her waiting bridegroom far away.
Where Rebekah loved her Isaac,
And he loved Rebekah fair;
Oh, it must have been a happy wedding day.

  Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
  Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
  There's going to be a wedding,
  And our joy will soon begin,
  In the evening when the camel train comes in.

Now the blessed Holy Spirit,
From our Father God above,
Has come down to earth to find a worthy Bride.
For our Isaac over yonder
Has prepared His tents of love,
And He wants His fair Rebekah by His side.

  Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
  Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
  There's going to be a wedding,
  And our joy will soon begin,
  In the evening when the camel train comes in.

We have left our kinfolk gladly;
We have bade the world goodbye.
We've been called to be His pure and spotless Bride;
Where we'll soon behold our Jesus
In that blest eternity
What a happy, happy wedding that will be!

  Oh, get ready! Evening shadows fall,
  Don't you hear the Eliezer call?
  There's going to be a wedding,
  And our joy will soon begin,
  In the evening when the camel train comes in.--------1319
That which for long the prophets sought,
The righteous yearned to see,
Has in these last of days appeared
In its reality.

  And we're now in the final stages,
  'Tis the completion of all the ages.
  All those who believed the promise
  Are perfected now in us.

Oh, blessed are our eyes that see,
Our ears, how blessed to hear;
Things angels ne'er could look into
Are now to us made clear.

  And we're now in the final stages,
  'Tis the completion of all the ages.
  All those who believed the promise
  Are perfected now in us.

Our sense is corporate, bold and strong,
His grace, how free to take;
Encouraging the others on,
Run for the kingdom's sake.

  And we're now in the final stages,
  'Tis the completion of all the ages.
  All those who believed the promise
  Are perfected now in us.

We're weary not this race to run,
It makes our joy complete;
For this we know, around the bend,
The Lord we'll surely meet.

  And we're now in the final stages,
  'Tis the completion of all the ages.
  All those who believed the promise
  Are perfected now in us.--------1320
We have seen the Lord is coming
For the church for whom He died;
We are in the age of ages,
When the Lord will take His Bride!

'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now, in this age, Christ will come!
So prepare ye now the church for the marriage,
Christ and the church will be one!

Praise God, in this age we're living,
Age of God's recovery.
We are in the local churches,
Where the Bride prepared may be.

'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now, in this age, Christ will come!
So prepare ye now the church for the marriage,
Christ and the church will be one!

Unreservedly we're giving
All, that He be satisfied;
For the life and for the building
Of His holy, chosen Bride.

'Tis a glorious age, the age of the ages,
Now, in this age, Christ will come!
So prepare ye now the church for the marriage,
Christ and the church will be one!--------1321
The grace which God bestows on us
Is just His Son in full;
The rich enjoyment of this Christ
Is plenteous, bountiful.
'Tis far too great to comprehend,
Too wondrous to contain:
How we, once children of despair,
God's masterpiece became.

The whole creation now beneath
The weight of bondage sore,
In seeing God's sons manifest
Is freed forevermore.
Th' eternal purpose of our God
Will be full manifest;
The hope of glory now concealed
Is then to all expressed.

The briars will be myrtle trees,
The thorn will be no more,
And peace will reign where war did rage,
The curse will then be o'er.
'Tis then the trees shall clap their hands,
And all the hills shall sing;
This glorious freedom shall God's sons
Thus manifested bring.

God's deepest work of grace goes on
Each day, though hidden, small,
Until that day, when manifest,
It is revealed to all.
By then God's wrought His finished work:
Himself dispensed to us;
And all creation 'round admires
His product, glorious.

The angels that before our God
In brightest splendor stand,
Will join the universal praise
To Him for all He's planned.
And of the devil, of his end . . . ?
We'll praise the Lord for how
Just distant smoke is all that's left
Of all that troubles now.

So shall we not delight to give
Ourselves in every way,
And let the Lord dispense Himself
Into us more each day;
The grace that we receive each day,
Though hidden oft, and small,
Is God Himself wrought into us,
That day to shine o'er all.--------1322
In spirit, in the church we see
The high estate we're destined for.
It's higher, vaster, more profound
Than anything we've seen before.

It's not a view in doctrine bare
But an unveiling of the Christ.
He's marvelous and far beyond
Our mental thought or power to share.

He's rich, unlimited, profound,
Immeasurable, and marvelous.
Yet 'tis a greater wonder still
He needs heirs of salvation  us.

God has accomplished many things
He's planned, created, and brought forth.
The Son is now appointed Heir,
Administrator of God's worth.

But in th' economy of God
There is not one, but many sons.
One is the firstborn Son of God
With many other living ones.

Christ will inherit all God's things,
And we're the heirs of God with Christ.
We're growing now to be matured;
As heirs we'll soon be legalized.

We're joint-heirs with the firstborn Son,
Inheriting the universe.
We're in this corporation vast
All partners of Christ and the church.

In spirit, in the church, we see
Our calling of unrivaled worth.
We're destined, not to go to heaven.
We're destined to be kings on earth.

We're paupers, yet we're glorious kings.
Inheriting the kingdom vast,
The earth, God's throne, and e'en all things
And all the Father is and has.--------1323
Song of Songs 2:8-17

The voice of my Beloved,
Behold, He quickly comes;
He leaps upon the mountains,
And o'er the hills He runs.
The signs of His appearing
Are seen on every side;
The Bridegroom soon is coming
To claim His loving Bride.

How real that He is coming
Come quickly, Lord, again!
We watch for His appearing,
His precious Word amen.
Oh, don't delay His coming,
Pray without ceasing, pray;
He's eagerly awaiting
That coming wedding day.

He longs to hear our voices,
He longs to see our face
Our voices filled with sweetness,
Our countenance with grace.
"Arise, My love, My fair one,"
We long to hear Him say.
The voice of our Beloved
"Arise and come away!"

The winter rain is over,
The flowers appear on earth;
The rising sun of Jesus
Fills all our hearts with mirth.
It is the time of singing,
The turtle dove is heard;
For our Beloved's coming
The sweetest chords are stirred.

Oh, let us take the foxes
That spoil the blooming vine;
Our vineyards are in blossom,
And all, Beloved, is Thine.
The day is quickly dawning,
The shadows flee away;
Upon the mount of spices
Our Lord may come today.--------1324
Our God is a God of purpose,
What He plans, He will fulfill!
Genesis to Revelation
Shows His full and glorious will.
What He's after is a building.
In creation He began
With a simple garden planted
This, the setting for His plan.

Man was made, the first step God took
To achieve His final goal,
As a vessel, a container,
Three parts  body, spirit, soul.
God, of dust, a body formed him,
Breath of life into him breathed
This part is man's human spirit
By which God may be received.

In the garden God had planted
Every tree He made to grow,
Good for food, to sight most pleasing,
And the tree of life also!
Second, then, in God's intention
Was that man should freely eat
Of the life-tree in the center
To obtain His life complete.

Third, we see a river flowing,
Out of Eden coming forth,
With its flow in four directions
East and west and south and north.
As on Christ our life we're feeding,
Living water in us flows.
Hallelujah for this river
And the watering it bestows!

In the flowing of the river
Gold, pearl, onyx stone we see;
Three materials, raw yet precious,
For God's building meant to be.
Look, these elements are shining!
How can we, then, shine as they?
Simply by the Lord, the Spirit,
Us transforming every day.

God the Father (in this fourth step),
Source of life, is gold divine;
Christ the Son was wounded by us
To produce the pearl so fine.
God the Spirit brings the stones forth
Transformation of the clay.
By the flowing of the Spirit
Changed we'll be from day to day.

Insufficient are materials
Precious though they be and best;
These must be built up together
That God's house they may express.
Fifth step: We ourselves hand over
To the building that we be
Built into God's house, His dwelling,
One in each locality.

Finally, in Revelation,
Is the picture of Christ's Bride
Consummation of God's purpose;
He is fully satisfied.
New Jerusalem, a city,
Is the Bridegroom's counterpart
So the church built up together
Forms the Bride for Christ's own heart.

How can we, as those who truly
Long to see God reach His goal,
Be united and related?
By denial of our soul!
As we contact Christ in spirit,
Feed on Him as life to us,
Then His life will flow, transform us
To His Bride, all glorious!--------1325
God eternal has a purpose,
Formed in His eternal past,
Spreading to eternal future;
'Twixt these ends all time is cast.
For with time there is the process,
Time for His accomplishment;
And in time we're merely travelers
For eternity we're meant.

God would have a group of people
Built together in His plan,
Blended, knit, coordinated
As His vessel  one new man.
God would come into this vessel
With His nature, life and ways,
Mingling Spirit with our spirits
For His joy and to His praise.

God has worked in three directions
For His plan so marvelous:
As the Father, Son, and Spirit
To dispense Himself to us!
All creation gives the setting
Heav'n and earth are for this plan;
'Tis for this God made a body,
Soul and spirit  three-part man.

As the center, as the kernel,
Of God's plan our spirit is;
Calling on the name of Jesus
Makes our spirit one with His.
From the center to circumference
God would saturate each part;
Feeling, mind, and will renewing,
Making home in all our heart.

Thus in life we're built together,
Then in love we're knit as one;
God is now His plan fulfilling,
Finishing what He's begun.
Lord, increase Thyself within us
That we might be built by Thee
Into that great corporate vessel
Filled with God exclusively.

As the product, the fulfillment,
Will the church in glory stand,
Consummation of the purpose
In eternal ages planned.
God will have His corporate vessel,
All his glory to contain;
Lord, we're wholly for Thy purpose
All Thy goal in us attain.--------1326
What is living all about,
Where's the answer? Let's find out!

  Call, "Lord Jesus!" Taste and see!
  Christ becomes reality,
  Life He gives abundantly
  As a river flowing free.
  With a new life we begin,
  Joy is springing from within,
  Love  He fills us to the brim!
  And it's all because of Him! (Hallelujah)--------1327
Once I thirsted for a fountain,
Something deep that would satisfy,
But the fountain that I'd drink from,
Left me searching and still so dry.
Then one day I found Him,
He satisfied my thirst,
Became in me a deeper source
Whence living waters burst.
Now I drink Him!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I'm fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.

After tasting such a fountain,
Longed my heart for a place of springs;
Caught a vision on a mountain,
In Jerusalem's a gathering.
Then one day He found me,
He brought me to the church,
Pleasures here abound fore'er
I've given up my search.
Hallelujah!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I'm fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.

Empty wanderer drop the striving
Isn't worth all the troublin';
Open up your heart believing,
Call "Lord Jesus" and He'll come in!
Then today you'll find Him,
And calling on His name,
You're joined to Him, you're one with Him
You'll never be the same.
You won't want to!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I'm fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.--------1328
My wandering days grew increasingly empty
As I searched for the way,
Just to fill this gap inside me
Found my seeking vain.

Though all this dark earth would convince me life's worthwhile,
Inside all my mirth
Was a cry for something real.
Don't you lie to me, world!

  For my heart tells me different
  When I hear of contentment
  Deep within a lack knew better
  Why not be honest, world!

A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story
Of a man they called Lord;
Yet my heart ne'er ceased to wonder,
Is He really Lord?

A search in His Word found my hardened heart softened,
And earth's vanities faded.
In the brightness of His presence
Jesus came into me.

  Now we're always together
  Growing into God's fullness.
  O Lord Jesus, how I love You!
  You brought life into me.--------1329
John 2 - 11

The wedding feast, the peak of man's enjoyment
Was full of pleasure till the wine ran dry.
The human life, like wine, is soon exhausted,
Till Jesus comes, divine life to supply.

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

One night a moral righteous man, a ruler
To Jesus came, more teaching to pursue;
But teachings ne'er could change the fallen nature,
So Jesus said, "You must be born anew."

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

"I have no husband," sighed the thirsty sinner.
Indeed her many husbands left her dry.
Daily she came to draw the failing water
Till Jesus came, her thirst to satisfy.

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

A man among the multitude lay helpless,
So weak while waiting till the water stirred.
Religion of the law could never heal him;
Then Jesus came and spoke the living word.

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

Within the tomb, four days and nights he lay there,
Death's grip had come; they 'round the grave did weep.
Silent he lay, all bound and wrapped in grave clothes;
Then Jesus came, and woke him from his sleep.

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.

And still today, this Jesus is so living,
Able to save from death in any form.
Now open up your heart and call upon Him;
To you He'll come, in spirit you'll be born.

  When Jesus comes, new wine is made from water,
  When Jesus comes, the darkness turns to light.
  He touches death  it's turned to life eternal,
  Weakness to strength and blindness into sight.--------1330
"All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come for the table now is spread;
Ye famishing, ye weary, come,
And thou shalt be richly fed.

  Hear the invitation,
  Come, whosoever will;
  Praise God for full salvation
  For whosoever will.

"All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come, for the door is open wide;
A place of honor is reserved
For you at the Master's side.

  Hear the invitation,
  Come, whosoever will;
  Praise God for full salvation
  For whosoever will.

"All things are ready," come to the feast!
Come, while He waits to welcome thee;
Delay not while this day is thine,
Tomorrow may never be.

  Hear the invitation,
  Come, whosoever will;
  Praise God for full salvation
  For whosoever will.

"All things are ready," come to the feast!
Leave every care and worldly strife;
Come, feast upon the Christ of God
And drink everlasting life.

  Hear the invitation,
  Come, whosoever will;
  Praise God for full salvation
  For whosoever will.--------1331
Just taste and see that the Lord is good;
Just taste and see that the Lord is good.
He's good for you, as He is for me;
So whatever you do, just taste and see.

Just call O Lord  He'll change your life;
Just call O Lord  He'll change your life.
Amazing grace He will afford;
If in every place you call O Lord.

You'll feel real love coming into your heart;
You'll feel real love coming into your heart.
You'll sense a flow from God above;
And you will know you've found real love.

So praise the Lord for His life in you;
Yes, praise the Lord for His life in you.
Something of Christ He has outpoured
Into your life; so praise the Lord!--------1332
Do you know that you were chosen
Long before the world began;
That by God you were selected
And appointed for His plan?
Something in your inmost being
Tells you this is surely true;
That's why you are in this meeting,
And you feel the way you do.

All the sins you've e'er committed,
Everything you've ever done,
All by God has been forgiven,
Taken care of by God's Son.
Struggle not, no; just believe this,
For His word assures it's true;
All you need to do is thank Him
For all that He's done for you.

Did you know that all the Bible
Is a will, a testament?
Everything that Christ accomplished
Is for all God's children meant.
As His child you are included,
For His word stands fast and true;
So by faith you now inherit
All that He has done for you.

Did you know God has a family?
Yes, He does, in fact, it's us.
That's why we are here enjoying
All He is, so marvelous.
He's our God and we're His people,
Day by day we love Him more;
We're so happy and so thankful,
We just praise Him o'er and o'er.

All we know is that we love Him,
We're so glad for what He's done;
We are brought to Him, and we all
Know the joy of being one.
We're so glad that we're included,
What a fellowship have we!
So we'd like to welcome you, friend,
Into God's own family.--------1333
What a happy day
When I no more could turn away,
When Jesus took my heart from the black of night
Into the kingdom of His light.

Now my life's begun,
The "really life" that's in the Son.
No more am I enthralled by earth's empty dreams;
Deep in me flows a living stream.

As I turn to Him
He fills me with His life within.
His life becomes my life in reality;
Oh, hallelujah, He's in me!

I just love You, Lord,
With other loves, You break the cord.
You'll be my life for all eternity;
You are the only One for me.--------1334
Psalm 30:11-12

Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me;
Thou hast put off my sackcloth;
Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me;
And girded me with gladness;
To the end my glory may sing praise unto Thee,
And not be silent.
O Lord my God, I will give thanks unto Thee forever.--------1335
Psalm 48:1-2

Great is the Lord, and greatly to be praised,
In the city of our God,
In the mountain of His holiness.
Beautiful in elevation, the joy of the whole earth,
Is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,
The city of the great King.
Is Mount Zion, on the sides of the north,
The city of the great King.--------1336
Psalm 116:12-13

What shall I give unto the Lord
For all, for all, for all He's done for me?
I'll take the cup of salvation,
And call, and call, and call upon the name of the Lord.--------1337
Psalm 126:1-6

When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
And our tongue with singing:
Then said they among the nations,
The Lord hath done great things,
The Lord hath done great things for them.

  The Lord hath done great things for us;
  Whereof we are glad.
  The Lord hath done great things for us;
  Whereof we are glad.

Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams,
As the streams in the south,
As the streams in the south.

They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

He that goeth forth and weepeth,
Bearing precious seed, shall doubtless,
Come again with rejoicing,
Come again with rejoicing,
Bringing his sheaves with him.

  The Lord hath done great things for us;
  Whereof we are glad.
  The Lord hath done great things for us;
  Whereof we are glad.

When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream.--------1338
Psalm 132:13-16

This is My rest forever;
Here will I dwell,
For the Lord hath chosen Zion,
He hath desired it for His habitation.

  He will abundantly bless her provision:
  He will satisfy her poor with bread.
  He will clothe her priests with salvation,
  And her saints shall shout aloud for joy.--------1339
Psalm 133

Behold how good and how pleasant it is,
For brethren to dwell together in unity!
Behold how good and how pleasant it is,
For brethren to dwell together in unity!

  It is like the precious ointment upon the head,
  That ran down upon the beard,
  Even Aaron's beard:
  That went down to the skirts of his garments.

Behold how good and how pleasant it is,
For brethren to dwell together in unity!

  It is like the precious ointment upon the head,
  That ran down upon the beard,
  Even Aaron's beard:
  That went down to the skirts of his garments.

As the dew of Hermon,
And as the dew that descended
Upon the mountains of Zion:
For there the Lord commanded the blessing,
Even life for evermore.--------1340
Isaiah 12:3-4, 6

Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
Out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day shall ye say,
Praise the Lord.

Therefore with joy shall ye draw water
Out of the wells of salvation.
And in that day shall ye say,
Praise the Lord.

  Call upon His name, declare His doings among the people,
  Make mention that His name is exalted.
  Cry out and shout, thou inhabitant of Zion:
  For great is the Holy One of Israel in the midst of thee.--------1341
Isaiah 51:11

Therefore the redeemed of the Lord shall return,
And come with singing unto Zion;
And everlasting joy shall be upon their head.

And everlasting joy shall be upon their head.

And come with singing unto Zion;
And everlasting joy shall be upon their head.--------1342

Therefore, they shall come and sing in the height of Zion,
And shall flow together to the goodness of the Lord,
For wheat, and for wine, and for oil, and for the young,
for the young of the flock and of the herd:
And their soul shall be as a watered garden;
And they shall not sorrow any more at all.--------1343
John 13:34-35

A new commandment
I give unto you
That you love one another
As I have loved you,
That you love one another
As I have loved you.

  By this shall all men
  Know you are My disciples
  If you have love one to another.

  By this shall all men
  Know you are My disciples
  If you have love one to another.--------1344
Romans 11:33-37

Oh, the depth of the riches and the
wisdom and knowledge of God;
How unsearchable are His judgments;
How untraceable are His paths.
For who has known the mind of the Lord,
Or who has been His counselor?
Or who has first given to Him,
And it will be repaid to Him?
Because out of Him and through Him
And to Him are all things.
To Him be the glory forever. Amen.--------1345

Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,
The veil shall be taken away.
So turn your heart to the Lord all the day,
And the veil shall be taken away.
Now the Lord is that Spirit,
And where the Spirit of the Lord is,
There is liberty  such liberty!
Whenever the heart shall turn to the Lord,
The veil shall be taken away.--------1346
1 Timothy 1:17

Now unto the King eternal, immortal, invisible,
The only wise God, the only wise God,
Be honor and glory forever and ever. Amen. Amen.
Be honor and glory forever and ever.
Amen.--------1347
Revelation 12:10-12

Now is come salvation and strength
And the kingdom of our God
And the authority of His Christ:
For the accuser of our brethren is cast down
Which accused them before our God day and night.

  And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb,
  And by the word of their testimony
  And they loved not their soul lives unto death.
  Therefore rejoice, rejoice, rejoice!--------1348
Revelation 21:3-5

Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
And He will dwell with them, and they shall be His people,
And God Himself shall be with them and be their God.
Behold, the tabernacle of God is with men,
And God shall wipe away all tears from their eyes;
And there shall be no more death, neither sorrow,
nor crying, neither shall there be any more pain,
For the former things are passed away.
Behold, I make all things new.--------1349
Repeat the last two lines of verses 1-3

What miracle! What mystery!
That God and man should blended be!
God became man to make man God,
Untraceable economy!
From His good pleasure, heart's desire,
His highest goal attained will be.

Flesh He became, the first God-man,
His pleasure that I God may be:
In life and nature I'm God's kind,
Though Godhead's His exclusively.
His attributes my virtues are;
His glorious image shines through me.

No longer I alone that live,
But God together lives with me.
Built with the saints in the Triune God,
His universal house we'll be,
And His organic Body we
For His expression corp'rately.

Jerusalem, the ultimate,
Of visions the totality;
The Triune God, tripartite man
A loving pair eternally
As man yet God they coinhere,
A mutual dwelling place to be;
God's glory in humanity
Shines forth in splendor radiantly!--------1350
God's eternal economy is to make man the same as He is
In life and nature but not in the Godhead
And to make Himself one with man and man one with Him,
Thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression,
That all His divine  that all His divine
Attributes may be expressed in human virtues.--------1351
Christ has come to be life, the processed divine Trinity.
God the Father's the source, a fountain emerging to be.
God the Son as a gushing up spring,
In the Spirit a river for life imparting.
Oh, how can this miracle be? The Triune God flowing in me!
Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!

  As this life flows through me, I'm supplied abundantly.
  His life nullifies sin!
  Power springs now from within!
  To be free, overcoming spontaneously.

Yet this life though it frees, is not meant for mere victory.
God is full of intent and never could flow aimlessly.
So this life has a totality, a consummate issue encompassing me.
Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows
Now I share in this life's destiny.
Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!

  We'll abide mutually, God and man revealed to be
  Lamb, Wife, Spirit, and Bride.
  Come! Drink! And riverside,
  Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!

So I've no cause to frown as one who's received this zoe.
I know life runs its course and triumphs inevitably.
I'm required just to stay in the flow,
If I do the drinking then God gives the growth.
So there's joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,
And a smile on my face as I sing,
Oh, I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!
I've got rivers of life flowing out of my innermost being!--------1352
God has called us for His purpose,
His economy so glorious,
For which He was fully processed;
Consummated now is He!
As the Spirit, He indwells us;
As our God alloted portion,
Working out His full salvation,
Making us the same as He is.

  Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of
  The Lord's economy direct my heart,
  And burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!
  With spirit strong and active we'll press on
  To consummate God's goal
  New Jerusalem, Hallelujah!

Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow,
He denied His natural man and
Was obedient unto death.
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication.
As the many grains we're blended
As His corporate reproduction.

  Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of
  The Lord's economy direct my heart,
  And burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!
  With spirit strong and active we'll press on
  To consummate God's goal
  New Jerusalem, Hallelujah!

Living out His resurrection,
Dying to the flesh and soul-life,
Living by the mingled spirit,
Natural man we will deny.
Now we're living in the Body,
Every day we're overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lord's appearing.

  Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of
  The Lord's economy direct my heart,
  And burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!
  With spirit strong and active we'll press on
  To consummate God's goal
  New Jerusalem, Hallelujah!

God and man will have one living,
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated;
One organic entity!
This the vision of the ages
Will control our daily living
That the Lord may have His Body
Shining as the holy city.

  Oh, may a clear, controlling vision of
  The Lord's economy direct my heart,
  And burn in me until my spirit's wholly set afire!
  With spirit strong and active we'll press on
  To consummate God's goal
  New Jerusalem, Hallelujah!
